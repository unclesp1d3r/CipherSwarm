# Analyze the project dependencies

1. Identify outdated packages
2. Check for security vulnerabilities
3. Suggest alternative packages
4. Review dependency usage patterns
5. Make the refactoring changes
6. Summarize what you reviewed and why

Always finish by running `just ci-check` and ensuring that all checks and tests remain green.
