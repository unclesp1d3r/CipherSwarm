# Review the codebase for performance

1. Identify performance bottlenecks
2. Check resource utilization
3. Review algorithmic efficiency
4. Assess caching strategies
5. Make the refactoring changes
6. Summarize what you reviewed and why

Always finish by running `just ci-check` and ensuring that all checks and tests remain green.
