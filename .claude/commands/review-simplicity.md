CODE SIMPLIFICATION REVIEW

Start by examining the uncommitted changes (or the changes in the current branch compared with main branch if there are no uncommitted changes) in the current codebase.

ANALYSIS STEPS:

1. Identify what files have been modified or added
2. Review the actual code changes
3. Apply simplification principles below
4. Refactor directly, then show what you changed

SIMPLIFICATION PRINCIPLES:

Complexity Reduction:

- Remove abstraction layers that don't provide clear value
- Replace complex patterns with straightforward implementations
- Use language idioms over custom abstractions
- If a simple function/lambda works, use it—don't create classes

Test Proportionality:

- Keep only tests for critical functionality and real edge cases
- Delete tests for trivial operations, framework behavior, or hypothetical scenarios
- For small projects: aim for \<10 meaningful tests per feature
- Test code should be shorter than implementation

Idiomatic Code:

- Use conventional patterns for the language
- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- Apply the principle of least surprise

Ask yourself: "What's the simplest version that actually works reliably?"

Make the refactoring changes, then summarize what you simplified and why. Always finish by running `just ci-check` and ensuring that all checks and tests remain green.
