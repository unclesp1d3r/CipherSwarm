# Review the test coverage

1. Identify untested components
2. Suggest additional test cases
3. Review test quality
4. Recommend testing strategies
5. Make the refactoring changes
6. Summarize what you reviewed and why
7. Always finish by running `just ci-check` and ensuring that all checks and tests remain green.
