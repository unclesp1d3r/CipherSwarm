## Basics

- Validate all input with Pydantic, never trust client data.
- Use dependency injection for user context / auth (even if fake for now).
- Escape any user-displayed data if rendered via `templates/`.

## Cursor Rules

- Always validate with Pydantic models before saving to DB.
- NEVER write raw SQL unless explicitly asked.
- If writing file input/output logic, sanitize paths and limit file extensions.
- Protect admin-only routes with dependency-based access rules.
