## API Style Guide

- All endpoints must include:
  - `response_model=...`
  - Summary + description via FastAPI decorators
  - Proper response codes (`200`, `201`, `404`, etc.)

## Cursor Instructions

- Group routes by resource (e.g. `agents`, `tasks`) in `app/routes/`.
- Use `tags=["agents"]` etc. for OpenAPI grouping.
- Never leave a route undocumented.
- Prefer Pydantic `BaseModel` subclasses with field examples in `app/schemas/`.
