## Background Task Handling

- Use `FastAPI.BackgroundTasks` or `asyncio.create_task` for async jobs.
- Jobs must live in `app/jobs/` and be named clearly (e.g. `dispatch_tasks.py`).
- Long-lived jobs should be tracked and idempotent.

## Cursor Rules

- NEVER block the main FastAPI event loop with long CPU tasks.
- Write jobs to be restartable or self-checking.
- Schedule recurring logic using `asyncio` or a simple task loop â€” avoid Celery unless the user asks.
