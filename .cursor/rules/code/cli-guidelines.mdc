title: CLI Design Guidelines
description: Standards for writing CLI tools and subcommands for CipherSwarm.

## Standards

- Use `typer` for CLI definition.
- Use `rich` for output formatting where appropriate.
- Subcommands go in `app/cli/` and should match core functionality:
  - `campaigns`, `agents`, `tasks`, `status`, etc.
- Each subcommand must be documented with `--help`.

## Cursor Rules

- All CLI entrypoints should be async-compatible.
- Place reusable CLI logic into `app/cli/utils.py` or services.
- Match file and function naming to subcommand (e.g. `campaign.py â†’ campaign()`).
