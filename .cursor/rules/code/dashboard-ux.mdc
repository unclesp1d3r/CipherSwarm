## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is the primary UI for CipherSwarm users. It provides a high-level view of all campaigns and their current attack status.

## Structure

- Display a **list of campaigns**, each with:
  - Name, status indicator, and summary stats (e.g., hashes cracked, time started, etc.)
  - Expandable section to view attacks (dictionary, mask, hybrid, etc.)

## Attacks View

Each attack displays:
- A name/label
- Status indicator:
  - ‚úÖ Completed
  - üïí Running (with progress bar or estimated state)
  - ‚è≥ Queued
- A human-readable status line (especially important for incremental/mask attacks)

## UX Notes

- Use HTMX for:
  - Expanding/collapsing campaigns via `hx-get` to load attacks dynamically
  - Live-updating attack status (`hx-swap="outerHTML"` or polling a progress endpoint)
- Use Tailwind for layout and Flowbite components for indicators/progress

## Cursor UX Guidance

- Render campaigns in cards or a vertical stack
- Use `hx-get="/campaigns/{id}/attacks"` to expand attack list
- Progress bar should use Flowbite‚Äôs `progress` component
- For non-quantifiable attacks, show a `text-gray-500` line with current activity status

## Example Structure

```html
<div class="campaign border p-4 rounded mb-4 shadow">
  <div class="flex justify-between items-center">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Campaign: Office Dump</h2>
    <span class="badge badge-success">Running</span>
  </div>
  <div class="text-sm text-gray-500">5 attacks ¬∑ 2 completed ¬∑ 3 running</div>
  <button hx-get="/campaigns/abc123/attacks" hx-target="#attacks-abc123" hx-swap="outerHTML" class="btn btn-sm mt-2">
    Show Attacks
  </button>
  <div id="attacks-abc123" class="mt-4">
    <!-- HTMX loads attacks here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

## Cursor DON'Ts

- Don't preload all attack data on initial page load
- Don't write raw JavaScript for polling ‚Äî use HTMX with `hx-trigger="every 5s"` where appropriate
- Don't build tables unless needed; prefer stacked visual indicators for clarity

Keep it usable for non-technical users who just want to crack a hash and watch it work.


### Additional UX Guidelines

- Show empty-state placeholders when no campaigns or attacks exist.
- Highlight campaigns with task activity in the last 5 minutes (e.g., background pulse).
- Stack dashboard layout vertically on viewports smaller than 768px width.
