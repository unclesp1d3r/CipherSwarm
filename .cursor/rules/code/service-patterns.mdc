## Layered Architecture

All business logic must live in services. These should:

- Contain reusable methods (e.g., `assign_agent_to_session()`)
- Interact with SQLAlchemy models and return data models (Pydantic)
- Be invoked by API routes or background jobs

## Guidelines for Cursor

- NEVER place DB logic in FastAPI route handlers.
- Each route should call a `service/*` method with relevant input.
- Service methods should be unit-testable and accept explicit arguments.
