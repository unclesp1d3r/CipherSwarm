## Principles

- Use `pytest` only, no unittest or nose.
- Prefer fixtures over mocks when integrating components.
- All new service logic must have corresponding tests in `tests/services/`.
- Avoid integration tests in unit test directories.

## Cursor Guidance

- Use descriptive function names (`test_assign_agent_to_session_succeeds()`).
- Group related tests into modules that mirror `app/` structure.
- Use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests.
- Only import `from app.services.X` or `from app.models.X` — don’t use relative imports.
