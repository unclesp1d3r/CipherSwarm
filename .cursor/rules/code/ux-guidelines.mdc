## Design Philosophy

- Clear layout using SvelteKit routing and layouts.
- No modal abuse: each form or dialog should feel native to the page.
- Use Flowbite Svelte and DaisyUI components to avoid custom styling.
- Responsive dark mode and keyboard accessibility are required.

## Interactions
- Use JSON POST/PUT endpoints for form submission.
- Display validation errors inline using Svelte component logic.
- Show toast notifications for success/error using `svelte-french-toast`.



## Component System

- Use **Flowbite** for accessible, Tailwind-compatible UI components (modals, alerts, dropdowns, tabs, pagination, etc.).
- Use **Tailwind CSS** utility classes for layout and spacing.
- Use **HTMX** for dynamic interaction (e.g., inline updates, modals, forms).

All forms must be covered by unit tests (Vitest) and E2E tests (Playwright).


### Accessibility and Component Hygiene

- All modals and alerts must use `aria-*` attributes correctly.
- Do not rely on external CDNs â€” keep all styling local.
