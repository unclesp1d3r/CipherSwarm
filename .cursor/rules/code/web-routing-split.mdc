# Web Routing Split

As of the SvelteKit transition, routing responsibilities are:

- **Frontend (SvelteKit)**:
  - Handles all `/` UI paths using file-based routing
  - Uses `load()` functions to fetch JSON from FastAPI backend
  - Displays views using Flowbite Svelte/DaisyUI components

- **Backend (FastAPI)**:
  - Handles all `/api/v1/web/*` JSON routes
  - Returns JSONResponse, never TemplateResponse

Use consistent URL shapes between API and frontend (e.g., `/api/v1/web/campaigns` â†” `/campaigns`).
