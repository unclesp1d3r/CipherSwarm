description: Prevents Cursor from editing critical or non-code files.
scope:
  - filesystem
tags: [protected, docs, migrations, safety]

## Hands-Off Zones

Cursor must not generate or modify code in the following directories unless explicitly asked:

- `alembic/`
- `docs/`
- `.cursor/`
- `.github/`
- `static/`
- `templates/`

## Rationale

These areas are either user-authored documentation, manually managed config, or external-facing assets.

## Cursor Guidance

- Do not generate new files in these directories.
- Do not propose code changes in these areas unless explicitly prompted.
- Suggest edits to Markdown files *only if* the user requests help writing or organizing them.
