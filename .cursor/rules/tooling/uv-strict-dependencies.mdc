description: Prevents Cursor from editing pyproject.toml directly and enforces use of `uv` CLI.
scope:
  - tooling
tags: [uv, poetry, pyproject, dependencies]

## Rule Summary

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for all Python dependency management.

## DO NOT:

- Manually edit `pyproject.toml` or `poetry.lock`
- Add or remove dependencies inline without using the proper command

## DO:

- Use `uv add PACKAGE_NAME` to install packages
- Use `uv add --dev PACKAGE_NAME` for dev dependencies
- Use `uv remove PACKAGE_NAME` to uninstall

## Cursor Instructions

- Never suggest editing `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` or `[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]` directly.
- If asked to install something, always recommend the appropriate `uv add` command.
- Do not generate or propose edits to dependency sections without confirmation from the user.
