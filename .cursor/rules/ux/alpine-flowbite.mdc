## Rule: Flowbite Styling + Alpine.js Behavior

Ensure Alpine.js behavior integrates cleanly with Flowbite component classes.

- Use Alpine.js for behavior control (`x-show`, `x-model`, `x-transition`) **only** — do not replace Flowbite's styling or structure.
- Retain Flowbite component classes for dropdowns, toasts, modals, sliders, and buttons.
- Use Alpine instead of `flowbite.js` plugin JS — no need to call `Flowbite.init()` or include its event handlers.
- If a Flowbite component has built-in JS behavior (like accordions), disable it and use Alpine's toggles instead.
- Keep class names like `bg-blue-700`, `dark:bg-gray-700`, `text-sm`, `rounded-lg`, etc. from Flowbite — Alpine should only manage visibility and state, not appearance.

### Example

```html
<!-- Toast example -->
<div
  x-data="{ show: true }"
  x-init="setTimeout(() => show = false, 5000)"
  x-show="show"
  class="p-4 mb-4 text-sm text-green-800 rounded-lg bg-green-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-green-400"
  role="alert"
  x-transition
>
  <span class="font-medium">Success!</span> Your wordlist was uploaded.
  <button type="button" class="ml-4 text-green-500" @click="show = false">
    ×
  </button>
</div>
```
