# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the implementation of advanced features and real-time capabilities for CipherSwarm's web interface. Building upon the core functionality verification, user management systems, Phase 2b Resource Management infrastructure, the completed crackable uploads pipeline, and the name-that-hash integration via HashGuessService, this feature set focuses on enhancing user experience through real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE), advanced attack configuration options, comprehensive resource management workflows, and enhanced campaign operations.

The implementation emphasizes lightweight trigger notifications rather than full data streaming, project-scoped security, MinIO-based object storage with presigned URLs, plugin-based hash extraction architecture, intelligent hash type detection using the name-that-hash library, and comprehensive testing coverage with both mocked and full end-to-end tests. All resource management builds upon the existing StorageService and AttackResourceFile models established in Phase 2b, while crackable uploads utilize the HashUploadTask, UploadResourceFile, RawHash, and UploadErrorEntry models with background processing pipeline and HashGuessService for automatic hash type inference.
