# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Control API v1 (`/api/v1/control/*`) provides programmatic access to all major CipherSwarm backend operations for command-line tools, automation scripts, and third-party integrations. This API powers the `csadmin` command-line interface and enables machine-readable workflows for campaigns, attacks, agents, hash lists, tasks, and system statistics. Unlike the Web UI API which is designed for human interaction, the Control API is optimized for structured, automated workflows with consistent JSON responses and RFC9457-compliant error handling.

The Control API serves as a thin wrapper around existing service layer functions, maximizing code reuse while providing API key-based authentication, project scoping, and offset-based pagination suitable for programmatic access. All endpoints enforce the same business logic and security constraints as the Web UI API, ensuring consistent behavior across interfaces.
