# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Phase 2 API Implementation represents the complete backend API architecture for CipherSwarm, providing comprehensive REST interfaces for all system interactions. This phase encompasses three distinct API surfaces: the Agent API for distributed hashcat instances, the Web UI API for the frontend, and the Control API for CLI/automation tools. Together, these APIs enable secure, scalable, and efficient coordination of distributed password cracking operations across multiple machines and user interfaces.

Phase 2 builds upon the core infrastructure established in Phase 1, implementing the service layer architecture, authentication systems, and business logic required to support the full CipherSwarm feature set. The implementation prioritizes backward compatibility with existing v1 agent integrations while introducing modern Rails 8.0+ patterns, comprehensive validation, and real-time capabilities via Hotwire.
