# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) test coverage for CipherSwarm Phase 3, addressing critical gaps identified in the current testing infrastructure. The focus is on implementing missing test scenarios that ensure complete user workflow validation, authentication integration, and UI component behavior verification. This spec is derived from the detailed analysis in the Phase 3 E2E Test Coverage Plan and aims to achieve 100% coverage of user-visible workflows across all user roles and device types.

The implementation follows CipherSwarm's three-tier testing architecture: backend tests (complete), frontend mocked tests (partially complete), and full E2E tests (infrastructure complete, authentication pending). This spec focuses on filling the gaps in the latter two tiers while establishing the authentication foundation required for comprehensive E2E testing.
