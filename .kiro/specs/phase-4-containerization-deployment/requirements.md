# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for Phase 4 of the CipherSwarm v2 rewrite: Containerization and Deployment. The goal is to enable reproducible, secure, and efficient deployment of CipherSwarm using Docker containers and Docker Compose, following FastAPI Docker best practices and CipherSwarm's Docker standards.

The scope includes containerizing the FastAPI application, PostgreSQL database, MinIO object storage, optional Redis cache, and Nginx reverse proxy for production deployments. The solution must support both development and production environments with single-command deployment capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: FastAPI Application Containerization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the FastAPI application containerized so that I can deploy it consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating development Docker configuration THEN the system SHALL provide a `docker/app/Dockerfile.dev` that uses Python 3.13 base image
2. WHEN creating production Docker configuration THEN the system SHALL provide a `docker/app/Dockerfile.prod` that uses Python 3.13 base image
3. WHEN building the container THEN the system SHALL use `uv` for dependency management
4. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL support hot reload for code changes
5. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL include a healthcheck endpoint
6. WHEN running the container THEN the system SHALL run as a non-root user for security
7. WHEN shutting down THEN the system SHALL support graceful shutdown handling

### Requirement 2: Multi-Service Docker Compose Configuration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Docker Compose configurations for both development and production so that I can deploy the entire stack with a single command.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up development environment THEN the system SHALL provide `docker-compose.dev.yml` for local development
2. WHEN setting up production environment THEN the system SHALL provide `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production deployment
3. WHEN defining services THEN the system SHALL include app, PostgreSQL 16+, MinIO, and optional Redis services
4. WHEN deploying production THEN the system SHALL include Nginx reverse proxy service
5. WHEN configuring storage THEN the system SHALL use persistent volumes for database, MinIO, and Redis data
6. WHEN managing configuration THEN the system SHALL use environment variables and secrets properly
7. WHEN monitoring services THEN the system SHALL include healthcheck and restart policies
8. WHEN possible THEN the system SHALL ensure Docker Compose files are compatible with Docker Swarm stack deployments

### Requirement 3: Database and Storage Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want persistent data storage and backup capabilities so that data is preserved across container restarts and deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring PostgreSQL THEN the system SHALL use version 16 or later with persistent storage
2. WHEN setting up MinIO THEN the system SHALL configure buckets for attack resources with TLS/SSL support
3. WHEN managing data THEN the system SHALL provide backup and restore procedures for database and MinIO
4. WHEN using caching THEN the system SHALL optionally configure Redis for Cashews caching and Celery task queues
5. WHEN running database migrations THEN the system SHALL automate migrations on deployment

### Requirement 4: Security and Best Practices Implementation

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the containerized deployment to follow security best practices so that the system is protected against common container vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running containers THEN the system SHALL run all containers as non-root users
2. WHEN configuring resources THEN the system SHALL set resource limits and quotas in compose files
3. WHEN possible THEN the system SHALL use read-only root filesystem
4. WHEN managing secrets THEN the system SHALL store secrets in environment files, never in images
5. WHEN deploying production THEN the system SHALL enable TLS/SSL for MinIO and Nginx
6. WHEN handling access THEN the system SHALL implement proper access key management for MinIO

### Requirement 5: CI/CD Integration and Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated Docker image building and testing in CI/CD so that container deployments are validated before release.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running CI THEN the system SHALL update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to build and test Docker images
2. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL provide `.github/workflows/docker-deploy.yml` for automated deployment
3. WHEN validating builds THEN the system SHALL ensure `just ci-check` runs in containerized environment
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL automate database migrations on deployment
5. WHEN scanning security THEN the system SHALL include security scanning for container images
6. WHEN building containers THEN the system SHALL automatically build and run-test all Dockerfiles (dev and prod) in CI
7. WHEN validating deployment THEN the system SHALL ensure Dockerfile build/run tests pass in `just ci-check`

### Requirement 6: Development and Production Environment Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized configurations for both development and production environments so that I can work efficiently locally and deploy reliably to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL provide hot reload capabilities with shared volume mounts
2. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL enable debug capabilities and local resource access
3. WHEN deploying production THEN the system SHALL optimize for performance and security
4. WHEN serving static files THEN the system SHALL configure Nginx for static file serving in production
5. WHEN handling SSL THEN the system SHALL provide SSL termination and rate limiting via Nginx
6. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL support service replication and load balancing

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Operational Capabilities

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want monitoring and operational tools so that I can maintain the deployed system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring health THEN the system SHALL validate health checks and graceful shutdown
2. WHEN aggregating logs THEN the system SHALL provide log aggregation and monitoring capabilities
3. WHEN updating THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime updates and rollback capabilities
4. WHEN backing up THEN the system SHALL provide automated scheduling and retention policies
5. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL support storage expansion and service replication
6. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive documentation for operational procedures

### Requirement 8: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing of the containerized deployment so that I can ensure the system works correctly in all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing locally THEN the system SHALL validate local dev stack with `docker compose up`
2. WHEN testing production THEN the system SHALL validate production stack with sample data
3. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL execute integration tests in containers
4. WHEN validating operations THEN the system SHALL verify backup and restore procedures work correctly
5. WHEN ensuring quality THEN the system SHALL verify all Dockerfile build and run tests pass in CI
6. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL validate that single-command deployment works: `docker compose up -d`
