# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SSR Authentication Foundation addresses the critical blocker preventing full E2E testing by implementing SSR-compatible authentication for SvelteKit with FastAPI backend integration. This feature enables authenticated server-side rendering, allowing all load functions to make authenticated API calls and enabling comprehensive end-to-end testing infrastructure.

The current architecture has SvelteKit SSR frontend (port 5173) and FastAPI backend (port 8000) as separate services, but all SSR load functions fail with 401 errors due to missing session management. This implementation adapts the existing FastAPI JWT authentication for SSR compatibility by storing JWT tokens in HTTP-only cookies and forwarding them from SvelteKit to FastAPI.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend JWT Cookie Authentication

**User Story:** As a backend system, I want to support JWT authentication via HTTP-only cookies in addition to Authorization headers, so that server-side rendered pages can make authenticated API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in through the web interface THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token in an HTTP-only, secure cookie
2. WHEN an API request includes a JWT cookie THEN the system SHALL validate the token and authenticate the user
3. WHEN an API request includes both cookie and Authorization header THEN the system SHALL accept tokens from either source
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear the JWT cookie and invalidate the session
5. IF a JWT token is expired THEN the system SHALL provide a refresh mechanism for long-lived sessions
6. WHEN CORS requests are made from the SvelteKit frontend THEN the system SHALL accept cookies with proper credentials handling

### Requirement 2: SvelteKit Server-Side Authentication

**User Story:** As a SvelteKit application, I want to handle JWT authentication in server-side hooks and load functions, so that I can make authenticated API calls during server-side rendering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is received THEN the SvelteKit hooks SHALL extract JWT cookies and validate them
2. WHEN a JWT is valid THEN the system SHALL set `event.locals.user` for use in load functions
3. WHEN a JWT is expired or invalid THEN the system SHALL redirect unauthenticated users to the login page
4. WHEN load functions need to make API calls THEN they SHALL use an authenticated server-side API client
5. WHEN API calls return 401/403 errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate redirects
6. WHEN in test environment THEN the system SHALL bypass authentication and return mock data

### Requirement 3: Login and Logout Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in and log out of the application using a secure web interface, so that I can access protected resources and maintain session security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the login page THEN I SHALL see a form with email and password fields using Shadcn-Svelte components
2. WHEN I submit valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate me and redirect to the intended page
3. WHEN I submit invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN I am logged in THEN I SHALL be able to access all protected routes
5. WHEN I log out THEN the system SHALL clear my session and redirect me to the login page
6. WHEN I refresh the page THEN my authentication state SHALL persist across browser sessions

### Requirement 4: Load Function Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all SvelteKit load functions to work with authenticated API calls, so that server-side rendering can access protected data from the backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any protected route is accessed THEN the load function SHALL make authenticated API calls to the backend
2. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN protected routes SHALL redirect to the login page
3. WHEN in test environment THEN load functions SHALL return appropriate mock data matching API response structure
4. WHEN API calls fail due to authentication THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
5. WHEN load functions execute THEN they SHALL use the authenticated user context from `event.locals.user`
6. WHEN environment detection is enabled THEN the system SHALL cleanly switch between test and production modes

### Requirement 5: Test Environment Integration

**User Story:** As a test suite, I want authentication to be bypassed in test environments with appropriate mock data, so that both mocked and full E2E tests can run successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST` or `NODE_ENV=test` is set THEN load functions SHALL return mock data instead of making API calls
2. WHEN running mocked E2E tests THEN the system SHALL provide fast feedback without backend dependencies
3. WHEN running full E2E tests THEN the system SHALL use real authentication with test user credentials
4. WHEN test data is provided THEN it SHALL match the exact structure of production API responses
5. WHEN switching between test modes THEN the transition SHALL be seamless and reliable
6. WHEN E2E tests run THEN they SHALL be able to log in and access all protected routes

### Requirement 6: Docker Infrastructure Compatibility

**User Story:** As a development and testing infrastructure, I want authentication to work seamlessly in Docker environments, so that both development and E2E testing can function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development Docker environment starts THEN JWT handling SHALL work correctly between services
2. WHEN E2E tests run in Docker THEN the authentication flow SHALL work with proper cookie handling
3. WHEN health checks are performed THEN they SHALL pass without breaking authentication requirements
4. WHEN CORS is configured THEN it SHALL allow proper communication between frontend and backend services
5. WHEN data seeding occurs THEN test users SHALL be created with known credentials for testing
6. WHEN hot reload is enabled THEN authentication changes SHALL be reflected without container restarts

### Requirement 7: Security and Session Management

**User Story:** As a security-conscious system, I want robust JWT token management with proper expiration, refresh, and cleanup mechanisms, so that user sessions are secure and properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JWT tokens are issued THEN they SHALL have appropriate expiration times
2. WHEN tokens are near expiration THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them
3. WHEN tokens are stored THEN they SHALL use HTTP-only and secure cookie flags
4. WHEN users log out THEN all session data SHALL be completely cleared
5. WHEN token validation fails THEN users SHALL be redirected to login with clear error messages
6. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN they SHALL provide clear debugging information without exposing sensitive data

### Requirement 8: Cross-Route Navigation and Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication state to persist across page navigation, browser tabs, and page refreshes, so that I have a seamless experience while using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate between protected routes THEN my authentication SHALL persist without re-login
2. WHEN I open the application in multiple browser tabs THEN my authentication SHALL work consistently
3. WHEN I refresh any page THEN my session SHALL remain active
4. WHEN I close and reopen the browser THEN my session SHALL persist according to token expiration settings
5. WHEN authentication state changes THEN all open tabs SHALL reflect the updated state
6. WHEN I access bookmarked protected URLs THEN I SHALL be authenticated if my session is valid, or redirected to login if not
