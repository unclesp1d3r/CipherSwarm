# CipherSwarm Product Overview

CipherSwarm is a distributed password cracking management system designed for efficiency, scalability, and airgapped networks. It coordinates multiple hashcat instances across different machines to efficiently crack password hashes using various attack strategies.

## Key Features

-   **Distributed Architecture**: Manages hash-cracking tasks across a network of agents/nodes
-   **Web Interface**: Modern SvelteKit-powered UI with real-time monitoring
-   **RESTful API**: OpenAPI 3.0.1 compliant API for programmatic access
-   **Scalable Workload Distribution**: Efficiently distributes tasks across multiple machines
-   **Hashcat Integration**: Leverages hashcat for versatile hash cracking capabilities
-   **Airgap Support**: Designed for secure, isolated network environments

## Core Concepts

-   **Campaigns**: Comprehensive units of work focused on a single hash list
-   **Attacks**: Defined units of hashcat work (mode, wordlist, rules, etc.)
-   **Tasks**: Smallest units of work assigned to agents for parallel processing
-   **Agents**: Registered clients that execute tasks and report results
-   **HashLists**: Sets of hashes targeted by campaigns
-   **Templates**: Reusable attack definitions for consistent workflows

## Target Audience

-   Medium to large-scale cracking infrastructure teams
-   Organizations requiring secure, controlled password recovery operations
-   Teams operating in airgapped or high-security network environments
-   Users with reliable, high-speed LAN connections between cracking nodes
