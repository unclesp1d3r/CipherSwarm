## Library Workarounds

### PostgreSQL Binary Location on macOS

-   **Issue:** PostgreSQL binaries from `libpq` package are incomplete and don't support all options needed for testing
-   **Solution:** Always use binaries from Homebrew PostgreSQL installation at `/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@16/bin/`
-   **Date:** 2024-03-26

## Datetime Best Practices

-   Always use timezone-aware alternatives (e.g., datetime.now(datetime.UTC)) instead of datetime.utcnow() to prevent DTZ003 lint errors and ensure correct, portable time handling throughout the codebase.
-   All datetime fields in SQLAlchemy models and Alembic migrations must use `DateTime(timezone=True)`.
-   All test data and application code must use timezone-aware datetimes (e.g., `datetime.now(UTC)`).
-   This enforcement prevents offset-naive/aware errors and ensures compatibility with PostgreSQL and asyncpg.

### FastAPI Redundant response_model Linter Rule (FAST001)

-   **Issue:** The linter rule FAST001 flags redundant `response_model` arguments on FastAPI routes. Including unnecessary `response_model` can cause linter failures and is not required if the return type is already explicit or not needed for OpenAPI.
-   **Established Pattern:** Do not add `response_model` to FastAPI route decorators unless it is required for OpenAPI documentation or type validation. Remove `response_model` if flagged as redundant by FAST001.

### v1/v2 API Compat Layer - Header Handling and File Routing

-   **Issue:** The v1 `/client` endpoints were handled by a compat layer (`client_compat.py`) that inherited header requirements from v2, specifically requiring a `User-Agent` header not present in the v1 OpenAPI contract. This caused 422/500 errors when the header was missing, and persistent test failures.
-   **Workaround:** Ensure that v1 compat endpoints do not require or validate headers not present in the v1 contract. Make all such headers optional and provide safe defaults when calling v2 logic. Always check which file actually handles a route in production, and remove unused/legacy files to avoid confusion during debugging.

### User-Agent Header Validation Removed

-   **Issue:** User-Agent header validation and requirements have been fully removed from all endpoints and services. No part of the system should check or require User-Agent for any API version.
-   **Action:** All tests that check for User-Agent validation (e.g., expecting 400/422 for invalid/missing User-Agent) are obsolete and should be deleted.
-   **Date:** 2024-07-08

## Project Troubleshooting

### Debugging API Routing and Handler Execution

-   **Lesson:** Never assume a file or function is in use based on naming or directory structure. Always verify which handler is actually registered and executed by tracing imports and router registrations.
-   **Practice:** When debugging endpoint issues, add direct print/log statements at the start of handlers to confirm execution. If a handler is not entered, check router registration and imports before investigating logic bugs.
-   **Directive:** If persistent test failures occur, especially with status codes or handler entry, use explicit debug output and route registration checks before making code changes. Remove or rename unused files to prevent confusion.

### Test Stub Defaults Are Not Business Logic

-   **Issue:** Removed `self.attack = attack or StubAttack()` from a test stub, treating the fallback as business logic, which led to brittle test failures.
-   **Lesson:** Ergonomic defaults in test stubs (e.g., `x or FakeX()`) are for developer convenience, not domain behavior. Removing them is only safe if all usage sites are audited and updated. Test scaffolding should be flexible unless strictness is required by the test.

### Authentication Architecture

CipherSwarm uses a unified user identity model.

-   There are two identity types in the system:
    1. Agent: Identified by a bearer token (csa\_\*) - machine identity
    2. User: Identified by either JWT (via login) or an API key (cst\_\*) - human identity

**Rules:**

1. âœ… JWT and API Key must resolve to the same User model instance
    - Never treat them as different user types. They're just two auth methods for the same identity.
2. âœ… All token parsing, validation, and resolution must live in core/auth.py
    - core/deps.py is only for DI wrappers like get_current_user().
3. âœ… Never duplicate auth logic across endpoints.
    - If a pattern appears more than once, refactor it into the auth module.
4. âœ… Permission checks must move to core/permissions.py as helper functions
    - No more inline `if current_user in project.users:` scattered everywhere.
5. ðŸ”œ When RBAC (e.g., Casbin) is introduced, all permission helpers should become policy-backed.

### Lesson: Validate Before Reporting

-   Never report a feature as done unless:

    -   All required code is present (including pyproject.toml for dependencies)
    -   Tests are implemented and **actually run**
    -   Runtime and linter errors have been verified clean

-   If you hit blockers (missing data, infra, flaky CI), escalate clearly â€” do not simulate success.

-   Passing tests in your head doesn't count. Run them or say you didn't.

Trust comes from accuracy. Overstating success breaks it.
