All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.6.7] - 2025-08-09

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Address critical bugs and performance issues in main branch

üö® Critical Security & Race Condition Fixes:
- Fix race condition in submit_crack method by wrapping entire operation in transaction
- Add strong parameter filtering to submit_status method to prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities
- Ensure data consistency during concurrent hash submissions

‚ö° Performance Optimizations:
- Optimize ProcessHashListJob with batch processing to prevent memory leaks on large files
- Improve uncracked_list method to eliminate unnecessary array operations
- Add critical database indexes for hash_items, agents, and tasks tables

üßπ Code Quality Improvements:
- Remove code duplication in JBuilder template for attack resources
- Add proper error handling and logging in batch processing
- Implement efficient bulk insert operations using insert_all/upsert_all

üìä Database Migration:
- Add composite indexes for frequent hash lookups (hash_value + hash_list_id)
- Add indexes for cracked hash queries and agent/task filtering
- Improve query performance for API endpoints

These changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving
system stability, security, and performance for production workloads.

- Improve upsert

- Enhance database configuration and entrypoint script

- Update database.yml to allow fallback to TEST_DATABASE_URL for test environment.
- Refactor docker-entrypoint script to improve argument handling for Rails server execution, ensuring proper database preparation before starting the server.

- Resolve Docker build failure with bootsnap precompile

- Move bootsnap precompile --gemfile command after application code is copied
- Fix BUNDLE_PATH environment variable issues by ensuring proper sequence
- Add separate bootsnap precompile steps for better error isolation
- This resolves exit code 7 errors during Docker build process

The issue was that bootsnap precompile --gemfile was running before the
application code (including Gemfile) was available in the container context.


### üé® Styling

- Fix RuboCop violations and improve code quality

- Auto-fix 30 style violations (symbol arrays, string literals, trailing whitespace, etc.)
- Add rake task description to routes.rake
- Improve thread safety in ApplicationConfig singleton pattern
- Add justification comments for intentional validation skipping in ProcessHashListJob
- Remove redundant RSpec type declarations in specs
- All RuboCop checks now pass (351 files inspected, no offenses detected)
- Security analysis with Brakeman still passes (no warnings found)


### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous Tasks

- Update Gemfile.lock and add new documentation rules

Bumped several gem versions in Gemfile.lock for improved stability and security, including active_storage_validations, aws-sdk-core, and rubocop. Additionally, added new documentation rules for core coding principles, memory management, Rails development guidelines, and implementation reasoning to enhance project standards and maintainability.

- Update Gemfile.lock and yarn.lock for dependency upgrades

Bumped aws-sdk-s3 to version 1.185.0 and updated several packages in yarn.lock, including @hotwired/turbo-rails to 8.0.13, autoprefixer to 10.4.21, and others for improved performance and security. Removed unused fields from HashListDashboard and updated documentation in various models for clarity and consistency.

- Update Rails documentation and tech stack requirements

Added instructions to use rbenv for Ruby 3.3.6 and included Docker for deployment in the tech stack requirements. Updated links to relevant Docker configuration files for better clarity and accessibility.

- Enhance Rails development guidelines

Added instructions for using rbenv to set up the Ruby environment and emphasized the importance of utilizing built-in Rails tools, specifically discouraging manual migration creation. These updates aim to improve development practices and maintain consistency across the project.

- Apply comprehensive code formatting and linting updates

- Update configuration files for code quality tools (.annotaterb.yml, .erb_lint.yml)
- Standardize indentation and formatting across all Ruby, ERB, and YAML files
- Apply SPDX license headers to ensure MPL-2.0 compliance
- Update development container and workflow configurations
- Improve code consistency and maintainability

This is a maintenance release focusing on code quality improvements.

- Update Ruby version in CircleCI configuration

Bumped Ruby version from 3.3.5 to 3.3.6 in the CircleCI configuration to ensure compatibility with the latest features and improvements. This change supports ongoing development and testing efforts.

- Update RuboCop configuration for improved linting

Modified .rubocop.yml to enhance plugin usage and formatting consistency. Changed 'require' to 'plugins' for clarity, updated exclusion patterns to use double quotes, and ensured proper alignment with Ruby style guidelines. These adjustments aim to streamline linting processes and maintain code quality.

- Enhance documentation standards across multiple files

Added new sections and improved formatting in core coding principles, memory management, Rails development guidelines, and implementation reasoning documentation. These updates aim to clarify expectations for code quality, testing standards, and documentation practices, ensuring consistency and maintainability throughout the project.
