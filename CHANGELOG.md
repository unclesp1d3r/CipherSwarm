Refactored admin index view to use partials for user and project rows. This change improves code readability and reusability. Added caching for partials to enhance performance.

- Simplify layout and make navbar persistent

Replaced individual Turbo tags with a combined method for clarity. Ensured the navbar retains its state with `data-turbo-permanent` attribute.

- Streamline hash list rendering in views

Simplify rendering of hash lists by using a partial in the index view. Consolidate the logic of individual hash list items and use Turbo Streams for dynamic content updates.


### üé® Styling

- Standardize Dockerfile stage names to uppercase aliases

Ensure consistent capitalization for Dockerfile AS stage names for clarity and readability. This change does not affect functionality but helps maintain a uniform style across the Dockerfile.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous Tasks

Include features like delete button for items, toggle for hiding completed activities, and refactorings for views and layout. Also note style changes and bug fixes for deprecated browser checks.

- Updated CHANGELOG.md


## [0.6.2] - 2024-09-23

### üöÄ Features

- Enhance docker-compose for production deployments

Updated healthchecks for services to use HTTP checks and added resource constraints and deployment configuration for better resource management and reliability. Introduced `sidekiq_alive` gem for improved Sidekiq monitoring and updated various dependencies to their latest versions.

- Implement caching to improve performance

Added Rails caching to multiple methods and queries to reduce database load and improve application performance. Introduced Redis as the cache store in the production environment for enhanced caching support.

- Update status pill indicator for running status

Replace status icon with a spinner for "running" status. This change enhances visual feedback by showing an animated indicator instead of a static icon when the status is "running".

- Display current running attack on agent show page

Add logic to display a link to the current running attack on the agent's show page. This includes a new method in the Agent model to retrieve the current running attack, if any.

- Add progress tracking and enhance status display

Introduce methods to track current iteration, device speed, and progress percentages in the Attack and HashcatStatus models. Updated the Task, Campaign, and view files to utilize these new methods, providing more detailed and organized information about attack progress and status.

- Add PWA support and update browser handling

Introduce PWA support with new service worker and manifest files. Update routes and asset files to accommodate PWA requirements. Modify CSS and add browser version handling in application controller.


### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Use after_commit instead of after_save for update_line_count

Changed the callback from after_save to after_commit to ensure update_line_count is called only after the transaction is committed. This prevents potential issues with partially completed transactions affecting the line count update.

- Reduce retry attempts and log line count

Reduced retry attempts for ActiveStorage::FileNotFoundError to minimize job delays. Added logging of line count to help monitor job execution and file processing.

- Remove touch option and modify callbacks and methods

The `touch` option was removed from the `belongs_to :campaign` association. The `after_create` callback was updated to `after_create_commit`. The `update_stored_complexity` method now updates the record directly, and the `force_complexity_update` method no longer calls `save`.

- Correct complexity_value comparison

Changed the comparison method for complexity_value to ensure it accurately checks for zero values as a float instead of an integer. This should prevent potential issues related to type mismatches during the comparison.

- Ensure campaign timestamp updates on hash cracking

Add touch method to campaign when a hash is cracked to update the campaign's timestamp. This change avoids potential issues with outdated campaign state information.


### üöú Refactor

- Extract attack stepper line into partial

Moved attack stepper line rendering logic to a partial. This change improves readability and makes the code easier to maintain by encapsulating repeated components.

- Update campaign table for improved responsiveness

Changed the table class to 'table-sm' for better mobile view compatibility. Realigned the indentation for better code readability. This improves the presentation and maintainability of the campaigns list.

- Optimize database migrations for hash_items and agents

Apply bulk changes in database migrations for hash_items and agents tables. This improvement uses the change_table method, streamlining the removal and addition of columns.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous Tasks

- Delete .idea/sqldialects.xml

Remove obsolete IDE configuration file. This cleanup helps in maintaining a cleaner repository by eliminating unnecessary project-specific settings.

- Enhance docker setup and optimize build process

Simplified .dockerignore patterns and centralized docker-compose resources and environment variables. Modularized Dockerfile build stages for better caching and added parallel setup option in config/dockerfile.yml.

- Update dependencies and clean up Gemfile and .gitignore

Updated various dependencies in yarn.lock and Gemfile.lock, including chokidar, electron-to-chromium, nodemon, sass, and turbo-rails. Removed spring and rack-mini-profiler from the Gemfile. Also cleaned up .gitignore and adjusted the require statement for the debug gem.

- Remove changelog file

Deleted changelog.yml to simplify repository structure. This file was moved to alternative documentation methods.

- Update CHANGELOG for v0.6.2 release

Add detailed entries for new features, refactoring, and bug fixes in version 0.6.2. Highlights include PWA support, progress tracking enhancements, and various improvements in performance and code readability.


## [0.6.1] - 2024-09-20

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous Tasks

- Fixed deployment issues discovered in 0.6.0 ([#186](https://github.com/unclesp1d3r/cipherswarm/issues/186))


## [0.6.0] - 2024-09-19

### üöÄ Features

- Added a blank slate component

I added a blank slate component to all the index pages to show when there is nothing and instruct the user to add an item. I also cleaned up the loading of associated resources in the view files by moving them into the controller and making them more reliable.

- Upgraded to Rails 7.2

- Attacks are now sorted by their complexity

We did significant refactoring across the entire application, including adding comments to nearly every class to make it easier to understand and enhance IDE‚Äôs understanding of the objects. We also calculated how complex an attack and the various attack resources might be so that we could automatically sort attacks with the easiest ones first. I‚Äôm sure I missed something in the calculation, but it‚Äôs a start.

- Add priority to campaigns

Introduced a priority enum to the Campaign model, with updated DB schema and associated logic. Enhanced CampaignsController to handle the new priority attribute and extended the Campaign model with new methods and callbacks for priority management.


### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with the activity feed erroring when a mask list was running

- SubmitAgentError no longer generates a cascading error if task isn‚Äôt found

- Resolved a weird bug breaking the docker builds

- Resolved a minor issue with shared masks not showing up in the attack editor

- Added tests and improvements to Project and Agent access control

We are implementing more granular control over abilities within the system, based not just on whether the user is an admin but also on their permissions on the projects associated with the resources. This cleanup effort involves writing controller tests to verify that permissions are working and fixing any situations where the tests fail. We started with the resources that aren‚Äôt children of projects.

- Updated the count file lines job to simplify it.

The job was unnecessarily complex and did not always function reliably if something glitched. I simplified it to improve reliability and updated it to work with RSpec 7.

- Simplified the permissions structure and added extensive tests

We were initially planning on having numerous roles per project, with different user levels having different capabilities, but that proved more complicated than it was worth. We removed all that, so any project member can manage anything within the project, but only a site admin can manage shared items. We then wrote extensive RSpec tests to validate this.

- Fixed a 500 error on the activities page when there are no tasks for an attack

- Add set_projects before_action for new/edit/create/update

Add a before_action to set accessible projects in both WordLists and RuleLists controllers. This ensures that project data is available for these actions, improving code consistency and maintainability.

- Display status for unprocessed line counts

Previously, line counts were always shown even if they were not processed. Now, the view renders "pending" for items that haven't been processed, improving clarity for users.

- Ensure proper error handling and task updates

Corrected error handling in task acceptance and alignment issues. Enhanced task update logic to prevent stale state overlap by excluding affected task IDs.

- Correct typos and streamline HTML elements

Corrected a spelling error in the campaign model's comments and streamlined the table row ID and iteration syntax in the campaign and attack partials for better readability and consistency.

- Update schema and add task completion checks

Renamed agent's 'active' field to 'enabled' and updated related comments in the schema. Added `mark_attacks_complete` callback in Campaign model to manage the task completion process dynamically. Refined task assignment logic in the Agent model to enhance performance and reliability.


### üöú Refactor

- Merged updates from issue 47

- Rename agent field `active` to `enabled`

Renamed the `active` field to `enabled` in the `Agent` model for better clarity. Updated associated views, tests, and database schema migration accordingly.

- Correct typo in priority enum comment

Fixed a typo in the campaign priority enum comment within the migration. Changed 'Defered' to 'Deferred' to ensure accurate documentation.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous Tasks

- Updated CHANGELOG

- Minor reordering of the Gemspec file

- Added railsboot vendor code to CodeClimate exclude

Since it is vendor content, it shouldn‚Äôt weigh against our score on CodeClimate, so I‚Äôm excluding the RailsBootUI components.

- Minor formatting changes

- Regenerated devcontainer with Rails 7.2

- Updated version of Ruby to 3.3.5

- Added newer annotaterb gem instead of annotate

- Updated dev container to include VS Code plugins

- Update dependencies in Gemfile.lock and yarn.lock

This commit updates several dependencies in the Gemfile.lock and yarn.lock files to their latest versions. These include `aws-partitions`, `aws-sdk-s3`, `turbo-rails`, `@hotwired/turbo-rails`, and other related packages. The updates aim to keep the project dependencies current and secure.

- Update docker-compose and remove sidekiq-worker

Remove sidekiq-worker service from both docker-compose and production configurations, and add Redis volume configuration and health check. Adjust replication and restart policy settings for increased reliability and streamlined service management.

- Disable RbsMissingTypeSignature inspection tool

The RbsMissingTypeSignature inspection tool has been disabled in the project settings. This change sets the tool's warning level to WEAK WARNING and ensures it is not enabled by default.

- Updated CHANGELOG.md

- Update Ruby image and improve CI configuration

Upgrade Ruby Docker image to 3.3.5 in CircleCI config. Add PostgreSQL service and database setup steps in GitHub Actions workflow to ensure consistency checks run smoothly.

- Remove database_consistency gem and related configs

Deleted the database_consistency gem from Gemfile and removed its configurations. This includes deleting the .database_consistency.todo.yml file and removing related checks in the CI workflow. Also updated Gemfile.lock accordingly.


## [0.5.4] - 2024-09-03

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Added rexml dependency


### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous Tasks

## [0.5.3-001] - 2024-09-03

### üöÄ Features

- Upgraded ruby and rails versions ([#181](https://github.com/unclesp1d3r/cipherswarm/issues/181))


### üìö Documentation

- Updated changelog format to include comments

We use an automatic changelog generator (git-chglog) and often include comment bodies to explain a change in our commits further. This update to the configuration will now include those explanations.


### üß™ Testing

- Added basic controller tests and cleaned up identified issues

I created bare stubs that test each controller action that is accessible via HTTP GET. This revealed a few routes that were either wholly unneeded or severely broken. I will continue adding more tests to flesh out the permissions model as I lock down some of the features to different roles.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous Tasks

- Update .gitattributes ([#180](https://github.com/unclesp1d3r/cipherswarm/issues/180))

Changed gitattributes to always use crlf, since we use dev containers on windows, so it should always be consistent with Unix formats.


## [0.5.3] - 2024-08-29

### üöÄ Features

- Updating an attack now resets it and makes it available


### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Resolved issue preventing the pause button from functioning


### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous Tasks

- Updated CHANGELOG


## [0.5.1-001] - 2024-08-27

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed major bug preventing creation of new campaigns

- Added cascade on foreign keys to remove children of hash lists if hash lists are deleted


### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous Tasks

- Minor reordering of the Gemspec file


## [0.5.1] - 2024-08-26

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with the activity feed erroring when a mask list was running

- SubmitAgentError no longer generates a cascading error if task isn‚Äôt found

- Resolved a weird bug breaking the docker builds


### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous Tasks

- Updated CHANGELOG


## [0.5] - 2024-08-26

### üöÄ Features

- Added support for mask lists on mask attacks

This allows files containing mask attacks to be attached in hcmask format.

BREAKING CHANGE

- Added soft deletion to attacks and campaigns

- Simplified attacks to only allow one each of resource files

The attack logic was becoming incredibly unwieldy because we were supporting combinator attacks. Every other attack type allows a single word list, rule list, or mask list. Support for combinators broke the UI and made the data structures more complex. We removed combinators and recommend just precalculating the combinator attacks as word lists.

- Major improvements in visual consistency and UI


### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Invalid benchmarks no longer block updates

- Fix blank users being created

- Agents only re-benchmark if they have no benchmarks

- Removed constraint on duplicate hashes

There was a weird bug where the hash item would get created as a duplicate but could never be updated or cracked because it didn‚Äôt meet validation. While fixing this, I realized that we might actually want duplicate hashes because there may be multiple users with the same password in a dump, and the metadata would differentiate them.


### üöú Refactor

- DRY‚Äôd up the attack resources and fixed the attack validations

- Minor cleanup of erb files


### üìö Documentation

- Grammer-checked the primary project documents


### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous Tasks

- Updated the Gemfile.lock to reflect the removed gem

- Bumped yarn packages

- Updated CHANGELOG


## [0.4.2] - 2024-08-07

### üöÄ Features

- Agents are now notified if there‚Äôs new cracks or the task is paused


### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Significantly improved standardization of the API

I made quite a few refactors to the agent API, but it is a significant breaking change.

MAJOR BREAKING CHANGE

- Tasks are no longer stale when the zaps are downloaded

- Refactor of API to 1.4 to make it more standardized. ([#168](https://github.com/unclesp1d3r/cipherswarm/issues/168))

- Fixed issue with benchmarks not being submitted correctly

For some reason, it only seemed to show up once we moved to benchmarking everything. Now, it is more resilient to write errors.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous Tasks

- Enabled the CI actions on the develop branch

- Updated changelog

- Delete backup files created in last merge

- Corrected issue with method order

This was a minor issue caused by the Rubocop-ordered methods check. I missed one of the API methods, but it did not break anything except the CI pipeline‚Äôs checks.


## [0.4.1] - 2024-08-01

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Removed unused agent properties

We added several properties to smooth the transition from Hashtopolis, but they didn‚Äôt make sense for CipherSwarm‚Äôs use case. We have removed them to clean up the functionality.

- Changed the agent benchmarks to aggregate benchmarks

For systems with multiple GPUs, the benchmark listing showed the speed of each GPU for the various hashes. While this might be useful for some, it was confusing and messy for most. It now adds the speeds of all GPUs for each hash, which more accurately reflects how Hashcat would use them.


### üìö Documentation

- Removed FOSSA scan that never really worked


### üß™ Testing

- Restored test for ordered methods

We used to test whether methods were in alphabetical order, but the Rubocop plugin that did that broke. Now that it‚Äôs working again, we are testing it again.

- Benchmark speed is now show in SI units


### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Clean up excessive hashcat statuses

The status count can now be configured as task_status_limit, which defaults to 10. All running tasks will only keep 10 status, all completed tasks keep no status.

- Jobs now retry 3 times when a record is not found

This fixes an issue with a hash, word, or rules list being deleted before it was fully ingested and the processing job just continually trying forever.

- Word and Rule Lists now require a project if marked sensitive

- Removed duplicate notifications on index pages
