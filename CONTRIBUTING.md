## Finding Something to Work On

### Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled with:

- `good first issue` - Perfect for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Areas where we need help
- `bug` - Issues that need fixing

### Areas You Can Contribute

- **Frontend (SvelteKit)**: UI components, user experience improvements
- **Backend (FastAPI)**: API endpoints, business logic, database models
- **Documentation**: Guides, API docs, code comments
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests
- **DevOps**: Docker configuration, CI/CD improvements

## Making Changes

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

2. **Make your changes** and test them locally

3. **Run tests** to ensure nothing is broken:

    ```bash
    # Backend tests
    pytest

    # Frontend tests
    cd frontend
    pnpm test
    ```

4. **Commit your changes** with a clear message:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add user authentication feature"
    ```

5. **Push to your fork**:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

### Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints, and write docstrings
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Use Prettier formatting, ESLint rules
- **Svelte**: Follow SvelteKit conventions and component patterns
- **Tests**: Write tests for new functionality

## Submitting Your Contribution
