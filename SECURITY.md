## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in CipherSwarm, please help us by reporting it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   * Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/UncleSp1d3r/CipherSwarm/security) of this repository
   * Click "Report a vulnerability"
   * Fill out the security advisory form

2. **Private Email** (Alternative)
   * Email: [UncleSp1d3r](mailto:unclespider@protonmail.com)
   * Subject: "CipherSwarm Security Report"
   * Include detailed information about the vulnerability
   * My PGP key is available [on keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/6F21D117858E4C8F7BE79DCFDEB64E8A0CA4ED3Ee)

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much of the following information as possible:

* **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, authentication bypass)
* **Affected component(s)** (e.g., web interface, API endpoints, agent communication)
* **Step-by-step reproduction instructions**
* **Proof of concept or exploit code** (if available)
* **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
* **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

### Response Timeline

As a single maintainer, I aim for the following response times:

* **Initial Response**: Within 1 week of report submission
* **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 2 weeks
* **Fix Development**: Varies based on complexity and my availability (typically 1-6 weeks)
* **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and tested

**Note**: I have a day job, so responses may be slower during busy periods.

### What I Can Handle

**I can investigate and fix:**

* Code vulnerabilities in the CipherSwarm codebase
* Configuration security issues
* Dependency vulnerabilities (via `uv`)

**I cannot handle:**

* Infrastructure security (deployment-specific)
* Network-level attacks
* Third-party service vulnerabilities
* Zero-day exploits in dependencies (I'll update when patches are available)

### What to Expect

* **Acknowledgments**: I'll confirm receipt and keep you updated
* **Timeline**: Realistic estimates based on my availability
* **Credit**: I'll acknowledge you in the advisory (if you want)
* **No monetary rewards**: This is a hobby project

**What I ask:**

* Be patient - I'm one person with limited time
* Provide clear reproduction steps
* Don't expect enterprise-level response times

### Security Update Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt of your report
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Release**: We'll release a security update
5. **Disclosure**: We'll publish a security advisory with details

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Operators

* **Keep CipherSwarm Updated**: Always use the latest supported version
* **Network Security**: Deploy behind proper firewall rules and network segmentation
* **Access Control**: Use strong authentication and limit user privileges
* **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for suspicious activities
* **Backup Strategy**: Maintain secure backups of your data

### For Developers/Contributors

* **Secure Development**: Follow secure coding practices
* **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated using `uv` and monitor for vulnerabilities
* **Testing**: Run security tests before contributing (`just ci-check`)
* **Code Review**: All changes go through pull request review process

## Known Security Considerations

### Agent Communication

* All agent communications use authenticated API endpoints
* API keys should be rotated regularly
* Use HTTPS in production deployments

### Password Handling

* CipherSwarm handles password hashes, never plaintext passwords
* Ensure proper access controls on hash list uploads
* Use appropriate network security when handling sensitive data

### Web Interface

* Session management uses secure HTTP-only cookies
* CSRF protection is enabled for all state-changing operations
* Input validation is enforced via Pydantic schemas

## Security Tools and Automation

This project uses several automated security measures:

* **Dependency Scanning**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
* **Code Analysis**: Static analysis via pre-commit hooks
* **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
* **Secret Detection**: Automated secret detection in commits

## Security Reality Check

This is a password cracking tool - by nature it handles sensitive data. Users should:

* Deploy in isolated environments
* Use strong access controls
* Monitor for abuse
* Understand the risks of running security tools

I focus on fixing code vulnerabilities, but users are responsible for their deployment security.

## Contact

For non-security related issues, please use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/UncleSp1d3r/CipherSwarm/issues) page.

For questions about this security policy, you can:

* Create a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/UncleSp1d3r/CipherSwarm/discussions)
* Open a general [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/UncleSp1d3r/CipherSwarm/issues)

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community's efforts in responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities. Contributors who report valid security issues will be acknowledged in our security advisories (with their permission).

**Note**: This is an open-source password cracking platform. While we take security seriously, users should understand the inherent risks of deploying security testing tools and take appropriate precautions for their specific use cases.
