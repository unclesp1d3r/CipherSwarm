# Controller for managing hash lists.
#
# This controller provides actions to manage hash lists, such as listing, creating, updating,
# viewing, and deleting hash lists. It ensures user authentication and authorization before
# performing any actions.
#
# Filters:
# - `authenticate_user!`: Ensures only authenticated users can access actions.
# - `set_projects`: Sets the list of accessible projects for specific actions.
# - `load_and_authorize_resource`: Handles resource loading and checks authorization.

  # GET /hash_lists or /hash_lists.json
  #
  # Fetches all hash lists that are accessible by the current user based on their abilities.
  # The method preloads associated `project` and `hash_type` records for optimization.
  #
  # @return [void] The method does not return a value but assigns the filtered and preloaded hash lists to the instance variable `@hash_lists`.
  #   - `@hash_lists` contains the collection of hash lists accessible by the current user's abilities.
  def index

  end

  # GET /hash_lists/:id or /hash_lists/:id.json
  #
  # Retrieves and displays the hash list along with its associated hash items.
  # Hash items are fetched in descending order of their creation date and can be filtered
  # based on their state (e.g., uncracked, cracked, or all). Pagination is applied to
  # the hash items, limiting the number of displayed items per page, and the method also
  # leverages HTTP caching to improve performance.
  #
  # - If `params[:item_state]` is "uncracked", only uncracked hash items are displayed.
  # - If `params[:item_state]` is "cracked", only cracked hash items are displayed.
  # - If `params[:item_state]` is not specified or is invalid, all hash items are displayed by default.
  #
  # @return [void] The method assigns several instance variables:
  #   - `@hash_items`: The filtered and paginated collection of hash items.
  #   - `@state`: The current filtering state, indicating the applied filter ("uncracked", "cracked", or "all").
  #   - `@pagy`: Pagy instance to handle pagination metadata for the view layer.

  # any related data are available for the view.

  # Responds to both HTML and JSON formats:
  # - On successful update, redirects or renders the updated hash list.
  # - On failure, re-renders the edit form or returns an error response.
