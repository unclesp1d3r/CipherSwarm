    Character sets define the types of characters to use for each position in the mask.
    By default, the attack will use the default character sets defined in the hashcat configuration.
    You can override these defaults by providing custom character sets below. They are referenced in the mask using '?1'
    through '?4'.

    Markov chains are used to generate passwords based on the probability of characters appearing next to each other.
    This can be useful for generating passwords that are similar to those used by the target.
    The classic Markov setting uses a pre-defined set of probabilities, while the disable Markov setting will disable
    the Markov chain. Leave the defaults if you are unsure.
