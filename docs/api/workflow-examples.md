## Campaign Creation and Management

### Complete Campaign Lifecycle (Web UI API)

This workflow demonstrates creating, configuring, and managing a campaign through the Web UI API.

#### Step 1: Authentication and Project Context

```bash
# Login and get JWT tokens
curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "email": "admin@example.com",
        "password": "secure_password"
    }' \
    -c cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/auth/login"

# Get current context
curl -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/auth/context"

# Switch to specific project if needed
curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"project_id": 1}' \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/auth/context"
```

#### Step 2: Create Hash List

```bash
# Create new hash list
curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "name": "Corporate Domain Hashes",
        "description": "NTLM hashes from domain controller",
        "hash_type": 1000,
        "project_id": 1
    }' \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/hash_lists/"

# Response includes hash list ID
{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Corporate Domain Hashes",
    "hash_type": 1000,
    "hash_count": 0,
    "project_id": 1,
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Step 3: Upload Hash Data

```bash
# Upload hash file or paste hashes
curl -X POST \
    -F "file=@domain_hashes.txt" \
    -F "hash_list_id=123" \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/uploads/"

# Or paste hashes directly
curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "hash_input": "user1:1000:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c:::\nuser2:1001:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:e19ccf75ee54e06b06a5907af13cef42:::",
        "hash_list_id": 123
    }' \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/uploads/"
```

#### Step 4: Create Campaign

```bash
# Create campaign
curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "name": "Corporate Password Recovery 2024",
        "description": "Recovering passwords from corporate domain controller dump",

    }' \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/campaigns/456/add_attack"
```

#### Step 6: Validate and Start Campaign

```bash
# Get campaign details to verify configuration
curl -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/campaigns/456"

# Start campaign execution
curl -X POST \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/campaigns/456/start"

# Verify campaign started
curl -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/campaigns/456/progress"
```

#### Step 7: Monitor Progress with SSE

```javascript
// JavaScript example for real-time monitoring
const eventSource = new EventSource(
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/live/campaigns",
    { withCredentials: true }
);

eventSource.onmessage = function (event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);

    if (
        data.trigger === "refresh" &&
        data.target === "campaign" &&
        data.id === 456
    ) {
        // Refresh campaign data
        fetch("/api/v1/web/campaigns/456/progress", { credentials: "include" })
            .then((response) => response.json())
            .then((progress) => {
                console.log(`Campaign progress: ${progress.percent_complete}%`);
                console.log(
                    `Cracked hashes: ${progress.cracked_count}/${progress.total_count}`
                );
            });
    }
};
```

### Campaign Management via Control API

```bash
# Set API key
export CIPHERSWARM_API_KEY="cst_123_abc123def456..."

## Hash Analysis and Type Detection

### Hash Type Detection Workflow

This workflow demonstrates using the hash analysis capabilities across different APIs.

#### Using Control API for Hash Analysis

```bash
# Analyze single hash
curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $CIPHERSWARM_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "hash_input": "5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592"
    }' \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/control/hash/guess"

# Response with hash type candidates
{
    "candidates": [
        {
            "hash_type": "MD5",
            "name": "MD5",
            "confidence": 95.5,
            "hashcat_mode": 0,
            "description": "32-character hexadecimal string"
        },
        {
            "hash_type": "NTLM",
            "name": "NTLM",

## Resource Management

### Resource Upload and Management Workflow

This workflow demonstrates managing attack resources (wordlists, rules, masks).

#### Step 1: Upload Wordlist

```bash
# Upload wordlist file
curl -X POST \
    -F "file=@custom_wordlist.txt" \
    -F "resource_type=wordlist" \
    -F "name=Custom Corporate Wordlist" \
    -F "description=Company-specific terms and patterns" \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/resources/"

# Response includes resource details
{
    "id": 101,
    "name": "Custom Corporate Wordlist",
    "resource_type": "wordlist",
    "file_size": 2048576,
    "line_count": 125000,
    "checksum": "sha256:abc123...",
    "upload_url": "https://storage.example.com/upload/...",
    "status": "processing"
}
```

#### Step 2: Monitor Upload Progress

```bash
# Check upload status
curl -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/resources/101"

# Response when processing complete
{
    "id": 101,
    "name": "Custom Corporate Wordlist",
    "resource_type": "wordlist",
    "file_size": 2048576,
    "line_count": 125000,
    "checksum": "sha256:abc123...",
    "status": "ready",
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T14:00:00Z",
    "metadata": {
        "encoding": "utf-8",
        "unique_lines": 124850,
        "duplicate_lines": 150
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Line-Level Resource Editing

```bash
# Get resource lines for editing
curl -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/resources/101/lines?page=1&size=100"

# Add new line to resource
curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "content": "newpassword2024",
        "position": 1
    }' \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/resources/101/lines"

# Update existing line
curl -X PATCH \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "content": "updatedpassword2024"
    }' \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/resources/101/lines/12345"

# Delete line
curl -X DELETE \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/resources/101/lines/12346"
```

#### Step 4: Create Rule File

```bash
# Upload hashcat rules file
curl -X POST \
    -F "file=@custom_rules.rule" \
    -F "resource_type=rules" \
    -F "name=Custom Transformation Rules" \
    -F "description=Company-specific password transformation rules" \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/resources/"

# Or create rules inline
curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "name": "Simple Rules",
        "resource_type": "rules",
        "content": [
            ":",
            "l",
            "u",
            "c",
            "$1",
            "$2",
            "$3",
            "$!",
            "$@"
        ]
    }' \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/resources/"
```

#### Step 5: Create Mask List

```bash
# Create mask patterns
curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "name": "Corporate Mask Patterns",
        "resource_type": "masks",
        "description": "Common corporate password patterns",
        "content": [
            "?u?l?l?l?l?l?d?d",
            "?u?l?l?l?l?d?d?d?d",
            "?l?l?l?l?l?l?d?d",
            "?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?d?d",
            "?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d",
            "?u?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?s",
            "?u?l?l?l?l?l?l?d?d?s"
        ]
    }' \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/resources/"
```

#### Step 6: Resource Validation and Preview

```bash
# Get resource preview
curl -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/resources/101/preview"

# Response with sample content
{
    "resource_id": 101,
    "preview_lines": [
        "password123",
        "admin2024",
        "corporate123",
        "company2024",
        "secure123"
    ],
    "total_lines": 125000,
    "encoding": "utf-8",
    "file_size": 2048576
}

# Validate resource content
curl -X POST \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/resources/101/refresh_metadata"
```

## Real-time Monitoring

### SSE-Based Real-time Monitoring

This workflow demonstrates setting up real-time monitoring using Server-Sent Events.

#### JavaScript/Browser Implementation

```javascript

## Batch Operations

### Bulk Campaign Management

This workflow demonstrates managing multiple campaigns simultaneously using the Control API.

#### Step 1: Bulk Campaign Creation

```bash
# Create multiple campaigns from template
for i in {1..5}; do
    curl -X POST \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $CIPHERSWARM_API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d "{
            \"name\": \"Batch Campaign $i\",
            \"description\": \"Automated campaign creation batch $i\",
            \"project_id\": 1,
            \"hash_list_id\": $((100 + i)),
            \"priority\": $((i * 10))
        }" \
        "https://api.example.com/api/v1/control/campaigns/"
done
```

#### Step 2: Bulk Campaign Start

```bash
# Start multiple campaigns simultaneously
curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $CIPHERSWARM_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "campaign_ids": [501, 502, 503, 504, 505]
    }' \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/control/campaigns/bulk_start"

# Response includes operation results
{
    "successful_count": 4,
    "failed_count": 1,
    "results": [
        {"campaign_id": 501, "status": "started"},
        {"campaign_id": 502, "status": "started"},
        {"campaign_id": 503, "status": "started"},
        {"campaign_id": 504, "status": "started"},
        {"campaign_id": 505, "status": "failed", "error": "Campaign already running"}
    ]
}
```

#### Step 3: Bulk Status Monitoring

```bash
# Get status of multiple campaigns
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CIPHERSWARM_API_KEY" \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/control/campaigns/bulk_status?campaign_ids=501,502,503,504"

# Response with all campaign statuses
{
    "campaigns": [
        {
            "id": 501,
            "name": "Batch Campaign 1",

## Error Recovery Scenarios

### Campaign Recovery Workflow

This workflow demonstrates handling and recovering from various error scenarios.

#### Scenario 1: Agent Disconnection Recovery

```bash
# Detect disconnected agents
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CIPHERSWARM_API_KEY" \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/control/agents/summary"

# Response shows offline agents
{
    "total_agents": 10,
    "active_agents": 7,
    "offline_agents": 3,
    "offline_agent_ids": [789, 790, 791],
    "affected_campaigns": [456, 457]
}

# Reassign tasks from offline agents
curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $CIPHERSWARM_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "offline_agent_ids": [789, 790, 791],
        "reassign_tasks": true,
        "notify_campaigns": true
    }' \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/control/agents/handle_offline"

# Monitor campaign recovery
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CIPHERSWARM_API_KEY" \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/control/campaigns/456/status"
```

#### Scenario 2: Campaign Failure Recovery

```bash
# Detect failed campaigns
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CIPHERSWARM_API_KEY" \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/control/campaigns/?state=failed"

# Get failure details
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CIPHERSWARM_API_KEY" \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/control/campaigns/456/errors"

# Response with error details
{
    "campaign_id": 456,
    "errors": [
        {
            "timestamp": "2024-01-01T14:30:00Z",
            "severity": "error",
            "message": "All agents disconnected during execution",
            "error_code": "AGENT_DISCONNECTION",
            "affected_tasks": [1001, 1002, 1003]
        }
    ],
    "recovery_suggestions": [
        "Restart campaign with available agents",
        "Check agent connectivity",
        "Verify network configuration"
    ]
}

# Reset and restart campaign
curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $CIPHERSWARM_API_KEY" \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/control/campaigns/456/reset"

curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $CIPHERSWARM_API_KEY" \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/control/campaigns/456/start"
```

#### Scenario 3: Resource Corruption Recovery

```bash
# Detect corrupted resources
curl -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/resources/101"

# Response indicates corruption
{
    "id": 101,
    "name": "Custom Corporate Wordlist",
    "status": "corrupted",
    "error": "Checksum mismatch detected",
    "checksum_expected": "sha256:abc123...",
    "checksum_actual": "sha256:def456..."
}

# Re-upload resource
curl -X POST \
    -F "file=@custom_wordlist.txt" \
    -F "replace_resource_id=101" \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/resources/"

# Update campaigns using the resource
curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "resource_id": 101,
        "update_campaigns": true,
        "restart_affected": false
    }' \
    -b cookies.txt \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/web/resources/101/refresh_metadata"
```

#### Scenario 4: Database Consistency Recovery

```bash
# Check system health
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CIPHERSWARM_API_KEY" \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/control/system/health"

# Response shows database issues
{
    "overall_status": "degraded",
    "components": {
        "database": {
            "status": "warning",
            "message": "Detected orphaned tasks",
            "details": {
                "orphaned_tasks": 15,
                "stale_sessions": 3,
                "inconsistent_progress": 2
            }
        }
    }
}

# Run consistency check and repair
curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $CIPHERSWARM_API_KEY" \
    "https://api.example.com/api/v1/control/system/repair"

# Response with repair results
{
    "repair_actions": [
        "Cleaned up 15 orphaned tasks",
        "Removed 3 stale agent sessions",
        "Recalculated progress for 2 campaigns"
    ],
    "affected_campaigns": [456, 457],
    "recommended_actions": [
        "Restart affected campaigns",
        "Verify agent connectivity"
    ]
}
```
