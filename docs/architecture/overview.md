### 4. Storage Layer

#### PostgreSQL Database

**Core Models:**

- `Project` - Top-level organizational boundary
- `Campaign` - Coordinated cracking attempts
- `Attack` - Specific cracking configurations
- `Task` - Discrete work units for agents
- `HashList` - Collections of target hashes
- `HashItem` - Individual hash entries
- `Agent` - Registered client systems
- `User` - Authenticated system users
- `AttackResourceFile` - Reusable attack resources
- `CrackResult` - Successfully cracked hashes

**Relationships:**

- Projects contain campaigns, users, and agents
- Campaigns target hash lists through multiple attacks
- Attacks generate tasks assigned to agents
- Agents report results and performance data

#### Cashews Cache

- **Default Backend**: In-memory for development
- **Production Backend**: Redis (optional)
- **Configuration**: `CACHE_CONNECT_STRING` setting
- **TTL Strategy**: Short-lived caching (≤ 60s) for health data
- **Key Patterns**: Prefixed by service type

#### MinIO Object Storage

- **Purpose**: S3-compatible storage for attack resources
- **Bucket Structure**:
  - `wordlists/` - Dictionary attack word lists
  - `rules/` - Hashcat rule files
  - `masks/` - Mask pattern files
  - `charsets/` - Custom charset definitions
  - `temp/` - Temporary storage for uploads
- **Security**: Presigned URLs, access control, encryption at rest
- **Integration**: Managed through Storage Service

### 5. Agent Network

#### Agent Components

- Hashcat integration for password cracking
- Resource caching and management
- Real-time progress reporting
- Error handling and recovery
- Health monitoring and benchmarking
- Device capability reporting

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant API
    participant Auth
    participant DB

    Agent->>API: Registration Request
    API->>Auth: Validate Registration
    Auth->>DB: Create Agent Record
    DB-->>Auth: Agent Created
    Auth-->>API: Generate Token
    API-->>Agent: Return Agent Token

    Note over Agent,API: Subsequent Requests

    Agent->>API: API Request + Token
    API->>Auth: Validate Token
    Auth-->>API: Token Valid
    API-->>Agent: Response
```

### Security Features

1. **API Security**
   - JWT-based authentication for web users
   - Bearer token authentication for agents
   - API key authentication for TUI clients
   - Rate limiting and request validation
   - HTTPS enforcement

2. **Agent Security**
   - Unique agent tokens with format `csa_{agent_id}_{random}`
   - Secure resource downloads via presigned URLs
   - Encrypted communication
   - Health verification and monitoring

3. **Resource Security**
   - Project-scoped access control
   - Resource verification and checksums
   - Secure distribution via MinIO
   - Audit logging for all operations

4. **Data Protection**
   - Project isolation for multi-tenancy
   - Hash data encryption
   - Secure credential storage
   - GDPR-compliant data handling

## Real-time Communication

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)

CipherSwarm uses SSE for real-time updates instead of WebSockets:

**Event Streams:**

- `/api/v1/web/live/campaigns` - Campaign/attack/task updates
- `/api/v1/web/live/agents` - Agent status and performance
- `/api/v1/web/live/toasts` - Crack results and notifications

**Event Format:**

```json
{
  "trigger": "refresh",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "target": "campaign",
  "id": 123
}
```

**Advantages:**

- Simpler architecture (no Redis dependency)
- Better reliability (browser auto-reconnection)
- HTTP-based (works through proxies)
- Perfect for one-way notifications
