### Is CipherSwarm v2 compatible with v1 agents?

Yes, CipherSwarm v2 maintains backward compatibility with v1 agents through the Agent API v1. However, some new features (like enhanced hardware management) require agent updates.

### How do I migrate from CipherSwarm v1?

Migration involves:

1. **Data Migration**: Existing campaigns, attacks, and resources are preserved
2. **User Accounts**: User accounts are migrated with appropriate project assignments
3. **Agent Re-registration**: Agents need new tokens and may require configuration updates
4. **Project Assignment**: Existing data is assigned to a default project

Contact your administrator for migration assistance.

## Authentication and Access

### How do I log into CipherSwarm v2?

1. Navigate to the CipherSwarm web interface
2. Enter your username and password
3. Select your active project (if assigned to multiple projects)
4. Access the dashboard and features

### What are the different user roles?

CipherSwarm v2 has three user roles:

- **User**: Basic access, can view campaigns and results
- **Power User**: Can create and manage campaigns, attacks, and resources
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management, and system configuration

### How do projects work?

Projects provide multi-tenant organization:

- **Isolation**: Each project has separate campaigns, attacks, hash lists, and resources
- **Access Control**: Users are assigned to specific projects
- **Security**: No data sharing between projects without explicit export
- **Management**: Administrators control project membership and permissions

### Can I access multiple projects?

Yes, users can be assigned to multiple projects. Use the project selector in the header to switch between projects. Your current project context determines what data you can see and modify.

### I can't see any campaigns or resources. What's wrong?

This usually indicates a project access issue:

1. **Check Project Assignment**: Verify you're assigned to projects with data
2. **Contact Administrator**: Request access to appropriate projects
3. **Verify Project Context**: Ensure you've selected the correct project
4. **Check Role**: Verify you have appropriate permissions

## Agents and Hardware

### How do I register a new agent?

Agent registration is now done through the web interface:

1. **Administrator Access**: Only administrators can register agents
2. **Web Registration**: Use the "Register New Agent" button in the Agents section
3. **Project Assignment**: Select which projects the agent can access
4. **Token Generation**: Copy the generated token (shown only once)
5. **Agent Configuration**: Configure the agent with the token and restart

### Why isn't my agent appearing online?

Common causes:

1. **Authentication Issues**: Verify the agent token is correct and not expired
2. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure the agent can reach the server via HTTPS
3. **Project Assignment**: Verify the agent is assigned to at least one project
4. **Configuration Errors**: Check agent configuration and logs

### How do I manage agent hardware settings?

CipherSwarm v2 provides enhanced hardware management:

1. **Device Toggles**: Enable/disable individual GPUs and CPUs

### What happens to resources when I delete an attack?

- **Ephemeral Resources**: Deleted automatically with the attack
- **Regular Resources**: Unlinked but preserved for reuse
- **Usage Tracking**: System tracks which resources are in use
