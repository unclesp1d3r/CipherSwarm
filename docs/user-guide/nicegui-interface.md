# NiceGUI Web Interface

## Overview

CipherSwarm provides an alternative Python-native web interface built with [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/) that is integrated directly into the FastAPI backend application. This interface offers the same core functionality as the SvelteKit frontend but with a more integrated deployment option that eliminates the need for a separate frontend server.

The NiceGUI interface is particularly useful for:

- **Simplified Deployment**: Single application deployment without managing separate frontend and backend services
- **Python-Native Development**: Easier customization and extension by backend developers familiar with Python
- **Integrated Authentication**: Seamless integration with existing FastAPI authentication systems
- **Reduced Infrastructure**: Lower resource requirements for smaller deployments

## Key Features

### Core Functionality

The NiceGUI interface provides complete feature parity with the SvelteKit frontend:

- **Dashboard Interface**: System metrics, campaign overviews, and real-time monitoring
- **Campaign Management**: Create, monitor, and control password cracking campaigns
- **Agent Management**: Monitor and manage distributed cracking agents
- **Attack Configuration**: Set up various password cracking strategies (dictionary, mask, hybrid)
- **Resource Management**: Upload and organize wordlists, rules, and other cracking resources
- **User Management**: Control access and permissions (admin functionality)
- **Real-time Updates**: Live progress tracking and notifications via Server-Sent Events (SSE)

### Technical Benefits

- **Single Container Deployment**: Runs entirely within the FastAPI backend container
- **Shared Authentication**: Uses the same authentication system as existing APIs
- **Python Integration**: Direct access to backend services and database models
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and tablet-friendly interface

# Setup FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Setup existing API routes
app.include_router(api_router, prefix="/api")

# Setup NiceGUI interface
setup_nicegui_interface(app)

# Run with NiceGUI integration
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ui.run_with(app, mount_path="/ui", storage_secret=settings.SECRET_KEY)
```

### Environment Variables

### When to Choose Each Interface

#### Choose SvelteKit Frontend When:

- You have dedicated frontend developers
- You need maximum performance and optimization
- You prefer modern JavaScript/TypeScript development
- You want to customize the UI extensively
- You're building a large-scale deployment

#### Choose NiceGUI Interface When:

- You want simplified deployment and maintenance
- Your team is primarily Python-focused
- You need quick customization by backend developers
- You're running smaller or resource-constrained deployments
- You prefer integrated, single-container solutions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Interface Not Loading

- Verify `NICEGUI_ENABLED=true` in environment variables
- Check that the application is running with `ui.run_with()` integration
- Ensure the `/ui/` path is accessible (check for proxy configuration issues)

#### Authentication Problems

- Verify session cookies are being set correctly
- Check that the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable is configured
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled in production environments

#### Real-time Updates Not Working

- Check SSE connection status in browser developer tools
- Verify that the backend SSE endpoints are using `text/event-stream` media type
- Check for proxy or firewall issues blocking SSE connections

#### Performance Issues

- Monitor memory usage if handling large datasets
- Check for excessive SSE connections or update frequency
- Consider adjusting update intervals for better performance

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for additional logging and error information:

```python
# In development
ui.run_with(app, mount_path="/ui", storage_secret=settings.SECRET_KEY, debug=True)
```

### Log Analysis

Check application logs for NiceGUI-specific issues:

```bash
# Docker logs
docker compose logs app | grep -i nicegui

# Application logs
tail -f logs/app.log | grep -i "ui/"
```

## Future Enhancements

The NiceGUI interface is actively developed with planned enhancements:

- **Advanced Charting**: Enhanced performance visualization and analytics
- **Bulk Operations**: Extended bulk management capabilities
- **Custom Dashboards**: User-configurable dashboard layouts
- **Mobile App**: Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- **Plugin System**: Extensible plugin architecture for custom functionality
- **Advanced Theming**: Additional theme options and customization
