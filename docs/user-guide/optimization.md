```

#### GPU Memory Optimization

Configure GPU memory usage:

```yaml
# Agent configuration
performance:
    gpu_memory_limit: 95  # Use 95% of available GPU memory
    max_tasks: 2          # Reduce concurrent tasks for memory-intensive attacks
    
hashcat:
    workload: 4           # Maximum GPU utilization
    optimize: true        # Enable hashcat optimizations
```

#### Temperature Management

Maintain optimal temperatures:

```yaml
# Temperature settings
hashcat:
    temp_abort: 90        # Abort at 90°C
    gpu_temp_retain: 80   # Target temperature
    
# Monitoring
monitoring:
    interval: 30          # Check every 30 seconds
    thermal_throttling_alert: true
```

### 2. System Configuration

#### Memory Optimization

```bash
# System memory recommendations
Minimum: 16GB RAM
Recommended: 32GB+ RAM for large campaigns
Optimal: 64GB+ RAM for enterprise deployments

# Memory settings
echo 'vm.swappiness=10' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo 'vm.dirty_ratio=5' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
```

#### Storage Optimization

```bash
# Use SSD for cache and temporary files
cache_dir: /ssd/cache/cipherswarm
temp_dir: /ssd/tmp/cipherswarm

# Storage recommendations
Cache: 100GB+ SSD for resource caching
Temp: 50GB+ SSD for temporary files
Database: SSD for optimal query performance
```

#### Network Configuration

```yaml
# Network optimization
resources:
    download_timeout: 300
    retry_attempts: 3
    parallel_downloads: 4
    bandwidth_limit: 100MB  # Optional bandwidth limiting
```

## Attack Optimization

### 1. Attack Strategy

#### Complexity-Based Prioritization

CipherSwarm v2 uses complexity scoring to optimize attack order:

```yaml
Attack Complexity Levels:
  1: Very Low    - Simple dictionary attacks
  2: Low         - Dictionary with basic rules
  3: Medium      - Mask attacks, hybrid attacks
  4: High        - Complex masks, extensive rules
  5: Very High   - Brute force, large keyspaces

Strategy:
  - Start with complexity 1-2 attacks
  - Progress to higher complexity based on results
  - Use previous passwords for targeted attacks
```

#### Keyspace Estimation

Use real-time keyspace estimation for planning:

```javascript
// Example keyspace estimates
Dictionary Attack: 14M words × 64 rules = 896M combinations
Mask Attack: ?u?l?l?l?l?d?d = 26 × 26^4 × 10^2 = 45.7M combinations
Brute Force: ?a^8 = 95^8 = 6.6 × 10^15 combinations

// Time estimates based on agent performance
RTX 4090: ~50 GH/s for NTLM
Estimated time: 6.6 × 10^15 ÷ 50 × 10^9 = 132,000 seconds = 36.7 hours
```

### 2. Resource Selection

#### Wordlist Optimization

Choose appropriate wordlists:

```yaml
Targeted Wordlists:
  - Previous passwords (highest priority)
  - Industry-specific wordlists
  - Geographic/cultural wordlists
  - Common passwords (rockyou.txt)

Size Considerations:
  - Small wordlists (< 1M): Fast iteration, good for testing
  - Medium wordlists (1-10M): Balanced performance
  - Large wordlists (> 10M): Comprehensive but slower
```

#### Rule Selection

Optimize rule usage:

```yaml
Rule Strategies:
  Basic Rules:
    - best64.rule: 64 high-quality rules
    - OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule: 52,000 rules (use carefully)
  
  Custom Rules:
    - Target-specific transformations
    - Year/date appending rules
    - Common substitutions (@ for a, 3 for e)

Performance Impact:
  - More rules = longer processing time
  - Quality over quantity approach recommended
```

#### Mask Optimization

Design efficient masks:

```yaml
Efficient Mask Patterns:
  Common Formats:
    - ?u?l?l?l?l?d?d: Capitalized word + 2 digits
    - ?l?l?l?l?d?d?d?d: Word + 4 digits
    - ?u?l?l?l?l?s: Word + special character
  
  Optimization Tips:
    - Use specific character classes when possible
    - Avoid overly broad masks (?a^12)
    - Consider known password policies
```

### 3. Campaign Configuration

#### Attack Ordering

Optimize attack sequence:

```yaml
Recommended Order:
  1. Previous passwords (if available)
  2. Small targeted wordlists
  3. Dictionary + basic rules
  4. Mask attacks (known patterns)
  5. Dictionary + extensive rules
  6. Hybrid attacks
  7. Brute force (last resort)
```

#### Parallel Execution

Configure concurrent attacks:

```yaml
# Campaign settings
max_concurrent_attacks: 3  # Run multiple attacks simultaneously
attack_priority: complexity_score  # Prioritize by complexity

# Agent distribution
agent_allocation: balanced  # Distribute agents across attacks
min_agents_per_attack: 1   # Minimum agents per attack
```

## Agent Performance Tuning

### 1. Workload Configuration

#### Workload Levels

Configure appropriate workload:

```yaml
Workload Settings (1-4):
  1: Low      - 25% GPU utilization, stable but slow
  2: Medium   - 50% GPU utilization, balanced
  3: High     - 75% GPU utilization, good performance
  4: Maximum  - 100% GPU utilization, maximum speed

Recommendations:
  - Start with workload 3
  - Increase to 4 if temperatures are stable
  - Reduce if experiencing thermal throttling
```

#### Device Selection

Optimize device usage:

```yaml
# Enable specific devices
backend_devices: "1,2"  # Use GPUs 1 and 2
backend_ignore:
    cuda: false         # Enable CUDA
    opencl: true        # Disable OpenCL (avoid conflicts)
    hip: true           # Disable HIP
    metal: true         # Disable Metal
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring
