# CipherSwarm Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for rebuilding CipherSwarm with FastAPI, SvelteKit, and modern backend architecture. Each phase builds upon the last and ensures a modular, testable, and maintainable system.

## 📝 Notes

-   [Core Algorithm Implementation Guide](core_algorithm_implementation_guide.md)
-   Phase 4 was moved up to phase 2b to allow for the resource management to be completed before the web UI is fully implemented. There's currently a TODO to reshuffle the phases to reflect this, but just move to 5 after 3 is completed.
-   As items in the various phases are completed, they are rolled up and added to this overview document.
