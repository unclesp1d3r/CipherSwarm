# CipherSwarm Campaign UX and Behavior

## üß† CipherSwarm ‚Äî Campaign UX and Behavior Context

### üéØ Campaign Attack Ordering

- Attack order should be **user-controlled**, not locked to creation time or estimated complexity.
- The campaign view must support **manual reordering** of attacks.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Campaign View Toolbar

- Toolbar should include:
    - **Add Attack** button:
        - Opens the attack editor in a **modal dialog**.
        - Appends the new attack to the **end** of the attack list.
    - **Sort by Complexity/Duration** button.
    - **Bulk Select Controls**:
        - Checkbox toggle for each attack.
        - **Check All** option.
        - **Bulk Delete** button (enabled only when at least one attack is selected).
    - **Start/Stop Toggle**:
        - Defaults to **Stop** while editing.
        - **Start** makes the campaign active and eligible for agent tasking.

### üß© Attack List Display (Within Campaign)

- Display attacks in a **table-like list view**.
- Each row includes:
    - **Attack Type** ‚Äî Rendered as a meaningful human-friendly label.
    - **Length** ‚Äî If defined (e.g., 1-8 characters); otherwise blank.
    - **Settings** ‚Äî One-line summary of config (non-technical), clickable to open editor modal.
        - Blank if using simple defaults (e.g., dictionary attack with no modifiers).
    - **Passwords to Check** ‚Äî Estimated keyspace.
    - **Complexity** ‚Äî Graphical (e.g., 1-5 stars or dots).
    - **Comments** ‚Äî User-provided description, truncated for display.

---

### üìã Attack Row Actions (Context Menu)

- Each attack row should have a menu (via right-click or button).
- Menu options:
    - **Edit**
    - **Duplicate**
    - **Remove**
    - **Move Up**
    - **Move Down**
    - **Move To Top**
    - **Move To Bottom**
- These should be **logically grouped** for clarity (e.g., editing vs. movement actions).
