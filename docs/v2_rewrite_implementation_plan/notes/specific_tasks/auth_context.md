### 🧠 Task: Project Context Management Endpoints

**ID:**

-   `auth.get_context`
-   `auth.set_context`
    **Context:** Web UI (Authenticated User Session)

---

#### 🧭 Purpose

CipherSwarm supports strict project-based isolation. Users can belong to multiple projects (especially admins, analysts, and consultants). These endpoints allow the Web UI to:

-   **Retrieve** the current user's active project and list of accessible projects
-   **Switch** the active project for all future interactions

The active project determines:

-   Which campaigns, attacks, agents, and resources the user can see
-   What scope new items are created under (e.g., campaign creation)
-   How HTMX templates are rendered and filtered

---

### 📥 `GET /api/v1/web/auth/context`

**`task_id:auth.get_context`**

Returns the current user's active project context and all projects they have access to.

**Response Example:**

```json
{
    "user": {
        "id": "uuid",
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "role": "user"
    },
    "active_project": {
        "id": 42,
        "name": "Acme Corp - Red Team"
    },
    "available_projects": [
        { "id": 42, "name": "Acme Corp - Red Team" },
        { "id": 99, "name": "Internal Testing" }
    ]
}
```

---

### 📤 `POST /api/v1/web/auth/context`

**`task_id:auth.set_context`**

Sets the current active project for the user’s session.

**Request Example:**

```json
{
    "project_id": 99
}
```

Must validate that the user has access to the specified project. Updates server-side session or secure cookie state.

---

### 🎨 UI Integration

-   Display the current project in the sidebar or account menu
-   Allow switching via dropdown or modal
-   Trigger a `POST /auth/context` request on change
-   Use HTMX swap or full reload to reflect new project scope

---

### 🔒 Security & Behavior Notes

-   Only allow users to switch to projects they are assigned to
-   Do not cache or persist project selection across users/devices without revalidation
-   Session or token context must be cleared on logout
-   Agent and Control APIs do **not** use this mechanism — they require explicit project scoping
