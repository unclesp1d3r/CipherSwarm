### 🧠 Task: Add Human-Readable Rule Preview Tooltips

**ID:** `attack.rule_preview_explanation`  
**Context:** Web UI (Phase 2/3) - Dictionary Attack Editor

#### 🔧 Backend Requirements (Already Done)

This task is already implemented on the backend and exposes a mapping from rule lines (e.g., `c`, `u`, `T0`, `r`) to short human-readable explanations (e.g., `c → lowercase all characters`, `T0 → toggle case of first character`, etc.).

#### 🎨 UI Goals

Enhance the **Rule List Dropdown** (used in the dictionary attack editor) by displaying **tooltips** next to each rule in the dropdown that show a short explanation of the rule.

#### ✅ Implementation Instructions for Skirmish

-   Use a [Flowbite Dropdown with search](https://flowbite.com/docs/components/dropdowns/#dropdown-with-search) for rule selection.
-   For each rule entry:

    -   Display the **rule file name** (e.g., `common-case-modifiers.rule`)
    -   Underneath or beside it, list each **rule line** with a brief explanation.
        -   Example rendering:
            ```
            Title Case Rules
            ├─ c  → Lowercase all characters
            ├─ u  → Uppercase all characters
            ├─ T0 → Toggle case of first character
            ```
        -   Can be inline with tooltips (`<span data-tooltip>`) or as a collapsible block beneath the rule name.
        -   For full rule syntax, fallback to a modal.

-   This is **preview only** — selecting the rule still works as usual.

#### 💡 Optional Enhancements

-   Add an info icon (`?`) next to the rule dropdown.
    -   Clicking it opens a modal via HTMX (`GET /api/v1/web/modals/rule_explanation`).
    -   Modal content includes a longer explanation of rule syntax and examples.

#### 🧩 Notes for Skirmish

-   HTMX can be used to preload rule explanations inline or lazy-load on hover.
-   If shown inline in the dropdown, explanations must not overflow or break alignment.
-   Tooltips should be styled clearly and be screen-reader accessible.
-   Do not allow users to edit rule lines here — this is strictly a read-only preview.
