## Flow 1: Login and Project Selection

**Actors:** Admin, Project Admin, User
**Triggers:** Landing at `/dashboard`

1. User logs in with username/password or valid session cookie
2. Backend returns list of projects user has access to
3. If more than one, user selects project
4. Project is stored in local session; however, the dashboard is not scoped to a single project. Users can see all system activity across all projects. For campaigns marked as sensitive, the campaign name is redacted for users without permission, but campaign state and presence are still visible to indicate system activity.

```mermaid
journey
    title Login and Project Selection
    section User
      Login with credentials: 3: User
      Choose project (if multiple): 3: User
    section System
      Authenticate credentials: 4: Backend
      Return project list: 4: Backend
      Store selected project: 3: Backend
```

---

## Flow 2: Real-Time Campaign Monitoring

**Actors:** All roles
**Triggers:** Dashboard load or SSE notification

1. Frontend fetches:

    - Campaigns (running, completed)
    - Active agents
    - Task progress

2. Dashboard top cards update via SSE:

    - Online agents (card click opens Agent Sheet)
    - Running tasks
    - Recently cracked hashes
    - System hash rate (8hr trend)

3. Campaign rows update:

    - Progress bars
    - State icons (running, completed, error, paused)
    - Attack summary and ETA

4. User expands campaign for attack-level detail

```mermaid
journey
    title Campaign Monitoring
    section User
      Open Dashboard: 3: User
      View campaign rows: 4: User
      Expand campaign details: 3: User
    section Frontend
      Fetch summary data: 4: Frontend
      Open SSE connection: 4: Frontend
    section Backend
      Push crack/task updates: 5: Backend
```

---

## Flow 3: Launch Campaign Wizard

**Actors:** User, Project Admin, Admin
**Triggers:** Click "New Campaign"

1. **User clicks** the `Campaigns` icon in the sidebar (collapsed or expanded), then clicks the `New Campaign` button — triggers `modal dialog` overlay.

2. **Hashlist Selection Step:**

    - Toggle between upload vs. select mode using a radio button
    - If uploading: file picker uses MinIO upload + spinner → success toast.
    - If selecting existing: dropdown of available hashlists.

3. **Campaign Metadata Step:**

    - User enters name, optional description, and toggles DAG support.
    - When DAG is enabled, campaign scheduling changes: no attack from a later DAG phase will be assigned to any agent until all attacks from the earlier phases are fully completed, even if other agents are idle.
    - Form uses standard text inputs, checkbox. Upon completion, the modal closes and the user is taken to the campaign editor to add attacks. A toast appears confirming the campaign has been created, and the editor screen scrolls or focuses to the attack configuration section. Smooth animation or fade-in is used to emphasize the transition without jarring the user.
      *(Transition to Campaign Editor page)*

4. **Add Attacks Step:**

    - On first load of a new campaign with no attacks, the Add Attack modal opens automatically after a short delay with a fade-in animation. This gently encourages configuration without jarring the user.
    - `Add Attack` button → attack editor modal opens.
    - User chooses attack type via radio buttons in a wizard step (options: Dictionary / Mask / Brute / Hybrid). Tabs are not used to reduce cognitive load and better fit the guided flow pattern.
    - Dropdowns for wordlist/rule/mask/charset.
    - Estimated keyspace is retrieved via the `/api/v1/web/attacks/estimate` endpoint, which returns a `keyspace` value (big int) and a `complexity_score` (1–5). The UI displays this using a dot rating (e.g., ●●●○○) with a tooltip indicating complexity level (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
    - Save adds attack to ordered list.

### Attack modal closes and user returns to Campaign Editor

1. **Review and Launch:**

    - List summary of attacks with keyspace, order, and comments.
    - `Launch Campaign` → disables button + shows spinner.

2. **Backend Response:**

    - Campaign + attacks created.
    - Tasks are scheduled.
    - UI returns to Campaign list with toast: “Campaign launched.”

## Flow 4: Agent Sheet View

**Actors:** User, Admin (manage)
**Triggers:** Click "Active Agents" card

1. Agent Sheet slides in from right

2. Each agent displayed with:

    - Status badge (🟢, 🟡, 🔴)
    - Last seen timestamp
    - Current task label
    - Guess rate + sparkline

## Flow 5: Crack Notification → Results View

**Actors:** All roles
**Triggers:** Crack event

1. Toast appears ("3 new hashes cracked")

2. Clicking toast opens a filtered hash results view:

    - Regardless of origin, user is taken to a unified hash results view scoped to cracked items.
    - Cracked items include plaintext, timestamp, hashlist label, and attack info.
    - Export/download options available based on project permissions

```mermaid
journey
    title Crack Event Notification
    section Backend
      Crack detected from agent: 5: Backend
      Store crack result: 5: Backend
    section Frontend
      Push toast: 4: Frontend
      Update campaign status: 4: Frontend
    section User
      Click toast: 3: User
      View cracked hashes: 4: User
```

## Flow 6: Upload New Resource

**Actors:** Project Admin, User
**Triggers:** "Upload Resource" on Resources page

1. User selects file and type (wordlist, rule, mask, charset)

2. User enters metadata: label (required), description (optional), and sensitivity flag (checkbox)

3. Frontend uploads via presigned MinIO URL

4. Backend:

    - Validates and extracts metadata
    - Stores record with UUID, label, description, and sensitivity status

5. UI updates with new resource available, showing metadata in the resource list

### Sensitivity and Access Behavior

| `project_id` | `sensitive` | Visibility                      | Editable By              |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |

**Actors:** User, Project Admin, Admin
**Triggers:** User clicks dropdown on campaign row

1. User opens campaign row menu (⋮)

2. Options: Pause Campaign, Resume Campaign, Archive Campaign, Delete Campaign

3. On Pause:

    - Confirmation modal explains task pausing behavior
    - Backend updates task statuses to "paused"
    - UI shows paused icon and disables attacks

4. On Resume:

    - Backend reschedules any incomplete tasks

        - The user may archive their **own** campaign
        - A Project Admin may archive any campaign in their project
        - An Admin may archive **any** campaign across all projects
        - In **all cases**, deletion is only allowed if the campaign has never run

    - Archive is a soft-delete: removes from active views but retained in DB

    - UI shows toast and updates campaign list

```mermaid
journey
    title Pause / Resume / Delete Campaign
    section User
      Open campaign menu: 3: User
      Click pause/resume/archive/delete: 4: User

    - PostgreSQL WAL and sync lag
    - Agent runtime stats (uptime, failures, retries)
    - Peak crack rate history

3. All metrics update via SSE every 5–10s

4. Option to refresh manually or download snapshot

```mermaid
journey

## Flow 12: Export / Import Campaign Templates

**Actors:** Admin, Analyst
**Triggers:** Click “Export” or “Import” on Campaign Wizard

1. User clicks Export on existing campaign → downloads JSON
2. User clicks Import → file picker + format validation
3. Imported template pre-fills campaign wizard
4. User can still edit before launching

## Notes for Skirmish

- Each flow should be mapped to API endpoints from `/api/v1/web/*`
- Use SSE for live updates
- Reuse Shadcn-Svelte components where possible
- Align with layo
