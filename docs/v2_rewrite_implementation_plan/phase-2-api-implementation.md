## Supporting Algorithms

### 🔍 Hash Guessing Logic

CipherSwarm should include a reusable hash analysis and type inference utility built around the [Name-That-Hash](https://github.com/bee-san/Name-That-Hash) library. This utility should be implemented in the service layer and callable from both the Web UI API and the Control API. It is responsible for examining pasted text, extracted hash lines, or uploaded artifacts and returning likely hash types based on structure, length, encoding, and known patterns.

The service must:

- Use `name-that-hash`'s native Python API (not subprocess)
- Wrap its response in CipherSwarm-style confidence-ranked outputs
- Be independently unit tested
- Be integration tested via the Web UI's hash validation endpoint capable of examining pasted text, extracted hash lines, or uploaded artifacts and returning likely hash types based on structure, length, encoding, and known patterns.

#### 🔧 Requirements

- [x] Accept pasted lines, files, or blobs of unknown hash material
- [x] Identify most likely matching hash types (from hashcat-compatible types)
- [x] Return ranked suggestions with confidence scores
- [x] Handle common multiline inputs like:

  - `/etc/shadow` lines
  - `secretsdump` output
  - Cisco IOS config hash lines

- [x] Normalize formatting (e.g., strip usernames, delimiters)
- [x] Expose results in a format usable by both API layers and testable independently

Example response:

```json
{
    "candidates": [
        { "hash_type": 1800, "name": "sha512crypt", "confidence": 0.95 },
        { "hash_type": 7400, "name": "sha256crypt", "confidence": 0.35 }
    ]
}
```

This layer will power:

- Crackable Uploads (Web UI)
- Direct hash submission tools (Control API)
- Potential future CLI tools like `cipherswarm guess-hash`

## 🌐 Web UI API (`/api/v1/web/*`) - **✅ COMPLETED**

### 🎯 Implementation Summary

The Web UI API provides a comprehensive REST interface for the SvelteKit frontend, delivering:

- **Campaign Management**: Complete CRUD operations with attack orchestration, lifecycle controls, and progress monitoring
- **Attack Editor**: Full-featured attack configuration with real-time validation, keyspace estimation, and template support
- **Agent Management**: Comprehensive agent monitoring, hardware configuration, performance tracking, and error reporting
- **Resource Browser**: File upload/download with inline editing, validation, and metadata management
- **Hash List Management**: Secure hash import/export with project-level isolation
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control and project context switching
- **Live Event System**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time UI updates without polling

## 🧾 Shared Schema: Save/Load

CipherSwarm supports export and import of core objects using a shared JSON-based schema. These templates are used by both the Web UI and the Control API to persist, modify, and replicate campaign structures across environments.

### 🔗 Scope

The following object types support import/export:

- Campaigns
- Attacks
- Resource Bundles (optional future feature)

### 📁 Usage

- Web UI: save/load dialogs, Crackable Upload post-processing
- Control API: `csadmin campaign export`, `csadmin attack import`, etc.
- JSON files may be checked into version control or bundled for transport

### 🧾 Format Requirements

- Schema must match Web UI expectations exactly (round-trip safe)
- All fields must be versioned implicitly or explicitly
- Reserved fields:

  - `schema_version` (optional)
  - `project_id` may be omitted or overridden during import.

### 🧪 Validation

- JSON templates must be validated against their Pydantic schema before use
- Cipherswarm should ignore unknown fields on templates

### 🔧 Sample Structure

Each referenced resource (wordlist, rule, mask) must use a stable UUID (`guid`) if it is a named, non-ephemeral file. This GUID is assigned at resource creation and used to re-link templates during import.

On import:

- If a referenced resource `guid` does not exist in the target project, the importer must prompt for a replacement, skip the attack, or abort
- Ephemeral files may be inlined in the template (e.g., a `wordlist_inline` or `masks: []` field)
  - `masks` is an array of strings, with each in hashcat mask `hcmask` format (`abcdef,0123,ABC,789,?3?3?3?1?1?1?1?2?2?4?4?4?4`) to allow custom character sets
  - `words` is an array of strings, with each a dictionary word, containing a single word or phrase that will be converted to a newline-separated list of words
- 📌 _Note: Standard Attack Resource Files are not embedded in save/load templates. Campaigns reference existing resources by ID. Resource metadata and crackable hash import/export are handled through the Resource API, not the template layer._

                "?l?l?l?l?d?d?d?d?d?d"
            ]
        }
    ]
