## Testing Strategy

### Three-Tier Architecture Integration

- **Layer 1**: Backend tests (Python + testcontainers) - ✅ Complete
- **Layer 2**: Frontend mocked tests (Playwright + mocked APIs) - ✅ Complete
- **Layer 3**: Full E2E tests (Playwright + real Docker backend) - 🔄 Infrastructure complete, authentication pending

### Test Environment Requirements

- Docker-based backend stack with seeded test data
- SSR authentication implementation for authenticated flows

- Performance baseline updates with changes
- Documentation kept in sync with test coverage

---

## Notes for Implementation

1. **SSR Authentication**: Critical blocker for full E2E testing - must be implemented first
2. **Test Environment**: Docker-based backend with predictable seeded data
3. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on previous test state
4. **Error Scenarios**: Include negative testing for all major workflows
5. **Performance**: Monitor test execution time and optimize slow tests
6. **Maintenance**: Keep test selectors and data synchronized with UI changes

### Design-Driven Testing Context

#### **Progressive Disclosure Testing**

- Verify complex options are hidden behind expert modes and revealed appropriately
- Test that UI complexity increases gradually as users need more advanced features
- Validate that default states show essential information without overwhelming users

#### **Real-Time Update Architecture Testing**

- Test SSE trigger-based updates (lightweight notifications, not full data streaming)
- Verify EventSource reconnection handling and graceful degradation
- Validate project-scoped event filtering ensures users only see relevant events
- Test batching logic for rapid events (>5 events/sec should be condensed)

#### **Accessibility & Responsive Design Testing**

- Keyboard navigation testing for all interactive elements (especially drag-and-drop alternatives)
- Screen reader compatibility for complex data displays and real-time updates
- Mobile touch target validation (minimum 44px touch targets)
- Color contrast validation for Catppuccin Macchiato theme

#### **Form Handling Philosophy Testing**

- Progressive enhancement validation (all forms must work without JavaScript)
- SvelteKit Actions integration testing (server-side validation with structured errors)
- Superforms integration testing (consistent form patterns across all features)
- Clean state separation testing (form state vs application state)

#### **Role-Based UX Testing**

- Admin-only function visibility testing (gear menus, management functions)
- Self-service vs admin-controlled function distinction validation
- Project context awareness testing (all UI elements respect current project)
- Permission boundary clarity testing (users understand what they can/cannot do)

#### **Information Density & Display Testing**

- Agent list compact view testing (essential data without clutter)
- Attack summary display testing (type, config, keyspace, complexity at a glance)
- Resource metadata visibility testing (line counts, sizes, usage info)
- Dashboard metrics card testing (real-time data without overwhelming detail)
