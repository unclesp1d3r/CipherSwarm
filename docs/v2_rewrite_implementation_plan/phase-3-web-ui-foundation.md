# Phase 3: Web UI Foundation (Rewritten for SvelteKit)

This phase finalizes the web-based UI for CipherSwarm using a modern JSON API architecture and a SvelteKit frontend. During Phase 2, many backend endpoints were completed. Phase 3 ensures the SvelteKit frontend is integrated cleanly, consumes JSON from `/api/v1/web/*`, and is styled with **Shadcn-Svelte** (not Flowbite). All user-visible routes must include proper Playwright E2E tests.

**🎯 Major Accomplishment**: The complete migration from HTMX/Jinja templates to SvelteKit has been successfully completed via the Template Salvage side quest. All legacy templates have been converted to modern Svelte components with comprehensive test coverage.

**🎯 Major Architectural Evolution**: Successfully migrated from SvelteKit SPA (static) to fully decoupled SSR architecture via the SPA to SSR Migration side quest. This fundamental change provides proper SEO, deep linking, progressive enhancement, and server-side data loading while maintaining modern SvelteKit patterns.

**🎯 Major Testing Infrastructure Evolution**: Successfully implemented a comprehensive three-tier testing architecture via the Full Testing Architecture side quest. This system provides fast backend tests, mocked frontend tests for rapid iteration, and full Docker-based E2E tests for complete integration validation.

Skirmish is responsible for implementing all views from scratch in SvelteKit using only JSON APIs. No templates from Phase 2 will be reused. This phase includes full component layout, state management, validation, and test coverage.

**✅ Template Migration Complete**: All Jinja templates have been successfully converted to Svelte components with full Playwright e2e test coverage and comprehensive unit test coverage where appropriate. The template salvage effort resulted in complete UI modernization.

**✅ SPA to SSR Migration Complete**: Complete architectural migration from SvelteKit SPA to decoupled SSR architecture with proper server-side data loading, form actions, and progressive enhancement. All routes now use SSR load functions with proper error handling and test environment detection.

**✅ Three-Tier Testing Architecture Complete**: Comprehensive testing infrastructure implemented with Docker-based E2E testing, service layer data seeding, and Playwright global lifecycle management. Testing patterns established for SSR applications with extensive lessons learned captured.

**🔄 SSR Authentication Analysis Complete**: Comprehensive analysis of SSR authentication requirements completed with detailed implementation strategy developed. Architecture patterns defined for session management, server-side API clients, and test environment integration. Implementation remains the critical blocker for full E2E testing capability.

A new test-seeding endpoint needs to be created in the backend to seed the database with the necessary data for the e2e tests. The existing e2e tests that rely on mock data need to be reclassified as integration tests, and new e2e tests need to be written that fully validate the functionality of the frontend and the backend together.

## Design Goals & User Experience Intent

This section captures the comprehensive UX design goals and interface patterns derived from the API implementation planning. These goals guide the frontend implementation to ensure a cohesive, user-friendly experience across all CipherSwarm features.

### Authentication & User Management UX

#### Design Philosophy

- **Self-service profile management**: Users can update their own name and email without admin intervention
- **Admin-controlled access**: Role assignment and project membership changes restricted to administrators
- **Clear permission boundaries**: UI clearly distinguishes between self-service and admin-only functions

#### User Interface Patterns

- **User list table**: Flowbite-inspired table component with filtering and pagination
- **Role-based UI elements**: Admin-only functions visually separated from user functions
- **Project context awareness**: All UI elements respect currently selected project context
- **Immediate feedback**: Profile changes and password updates provide instant confirmation

### Campaign Management UX

#### Core Design Goals

- **Intuitive attack ordering**: Visual drag-and-drop interface with keyboard support for accessibility
- **Rich attack summaries**: Each attack displays type, configuration summary, keyspace, and complexity at a glance
- **Lifecycle state clarity**: Clear visual indicators for draft, active, and archived campaigns
- **Performance transparency**: Real-time progress updates and agent participation visibility

#### Attack Management Patterns

- **Context-aware actions**: Attack actions (edit, duplicate, delete) adapt based on current state
- **Bulk operations**: Multi-select capabilities for efficient attack management
- **Visual hierarchy**: Attack positioning clearly communicated through UI ordering
- **Smart defaults**: New attacks inherit sensible defaults from campaign context

#### User Workflow Support

- **Progressive disclosure**: Complex attack configurations revealed progressively
- **Validation feedback**: Real-time keyspace and complexity estimation during editing
- **Confirmation patterns**: Destructive actions require explicit confirmation with impact assessment
- **Template reuse**: Export/import functionality for attack and campaign templates

### Attack Editor UX

#### Universal Design Principles

- **Real-time feedback**: Dynamic keyspace and complexity updates for unsaved changes
- **Lifecycle awareness**: Warnings and confirmations when editing running/exhausted attacks
- **Template support**: JSON export/import for attack configuration reuse
- **Progressive enhancement**: Complex options hidden behind expert modes

#### Dictionary Attack Interface

- **Smart defaults**: Min/max length fields default to hash type-appropriate ranges
- **Intelligent search**: Wordlist dropdown with search, sorted by last modified, shows entry counts
- **User-friendly modifiers**: Button group for common transformations (Change Case, Substitute Characters)
- **Expert options**: Optional rule list dropdown for advanced users
- **Dynamic wordlists**: "Previous Passwords" option automatically generates from project history
- **Ephemeral lists**: "Add Word" interface for small, attack-specific wordlists

#### Mask Attack Interface

- **Inline editing**: Add/remove mask lines directly in the interface
- **Real-time validation**: Immediate feedback on mask syntax correctness
- **Ephemeral storage**: Mask lists stored with attack, cleaned up on deletion
- **Syntax assistance**: Visual indicators and error messages for invalid masks

#### Brute Force Interface

- **Visual charset selection**: Checkboxes for Lowercase, Uppercase, Numbers, Symbols, Space
- **Range controls**: Intuitive slider for min/max length selection
- **Automatic generation**: System generates appropriate `?1?1?...` masks based on selections
- **Charset derivation**: Selected character types automatically populate custom charset 1

### Agent Management UX

#### Agent List Design

- **Information density**: Compact view showing name+OS, status, temperature, utilization, performance, current job
- **Role-based actions**: Admin-only gear menu with disable/details options
- **Real-time updates**: Live status updates without page refresh
- **Quick registration**: Modal interface for new agent setup with immediate token display

#### Agent Detail Interface Structure

##### Settings Tab

- **Display name logic**: `agent.custom_label or agent.host_name` fallback pattern
- **Essential controls**: Enable/disable toggle, update interval, native hashcat option
- **Benchmark control**: Toggle for additional hash types (`--benchmark-all`)
- **Project assignment**: Multi-toggle interface for project membership
- **System information**: Read-only OS, IP, signature, and token display

##### Hardware Tab

- **Device management**: Individual toggles for each backend device from `--backend-info`
- **State-aware prompting**: Apply now/next task/cancel options when tasks are running
- **Graceful degradation**: Gray placeholders when device info not yet available
- **Hardware limits**: Temperature abort thresholds and OpenCL device type selection
- **Backend toggles**: CUDA, HIP, Metal, OpenCL backend management

##### Performance Tab

- **Time series visualization**: Line charts of guess rates over 8-hour windows
- **Device-specific metrics**: Individual donut charts showing utilization percentages
- **Live updates**: Real-time data via Server-Sent Events
- **Historical context**: Performance trends and comparative analysis

##### Log Tab

- **Timeline interface**: Chronological `AgentError` entries with color-coded severity
- **Rich context**: Message, code, task links, and expandable details
- **Filtering capabilities**: Search and filter by severity, time range, task association

##### Capabilities Tab

- **Comprehensive benchmarks**: Table view with toggle/hash ID/name/speed/category
- **Expandable details**: Per-device breakdowns for multi-GPU systems
- **Search and filter**: Quick access to specific hash types and performance data
- **Benchmark management**: Header button to trigger new benchmark runs

### Resource Management UX

#### Resource Browser Design

- **Type-aware interface**: Different editing modes based on resource type (mask, rule, wordlist, charset)
- **Size-based editing**: Inline editing for small files, download/reupload for large files
- **Metadata visibility**: Line counts, file sizes, and usage information prominently displayed
- **Project scoping**: Resources filtered by project context with admin override

#### Line-Oriented Editing

- **Individual line control**: Add, edit, delete operations on specific lines
- **Real-time validation**: Immediate syntax checking with detailed error messages
- **Batch operations**: Validate entire files with structured error reporting
- **Preview modes**: Content preview without full editing commitment

#### Upload Workflow

- **Type detection**: Automatic resource type identification from content
- **Validation pipeline**: Multi-stage validation with clear error reporting
- **Metadata capture**: Comprehensive metadata collection during upload
- **Orphan prevention**: Atomic operations preventing database/storage inconsistencies

### Crackable Uploads UX

#### Streamlined Workflow Design

- **Dual input modes**: Support both file uploads and direct hash pasting
- **Intelligent parsing**: Automatic hash isolation from surrounding metadata (shadow files, NTLM pairs)
- **Type detection**: Automated hash type identification with confidence scoring
- **Validation pipeline**: Multi-stage validation preventing malformed campaign creation

#### User Workflow Support

- **Preview interface**: Confirmation screen showing detected types and parsed samples
- **Override capabilities**: Manual hash type selection when auto-detection fails
- **Dynamic wordlist generation**: Automatic wordlist creation from usernames/prior passwords
- **Progress visibility**: Clear status updates during upload and processing phases

### Real-Time Updates & Notifications

#### Server-Sent Events Design

- **Lightweight notifications**: Trigger-based updates rather than full data streaming
- **Targeted refreshes**: Specific component updates rather than page-wide refreshes
- **Reliable connections**: Browser-handled reconnection with graceful degradation
- **Project scoping**: Events filtered by user's current project context

#### Toast Notification System

- **Event categorization**: Different notification types for cracks, errors, status changes
- **Batching logic**: Multiple rapid events condensed into summary notifications
- **User control**: Dismissible notifications with appropriate persistence
- **Visual hierarchy**: Color coding and iconography for quick recognition

### Visual Design System

#### Theme Foundation

- **Catppuccin Macchiato**: Base color palette for consistent visual identity
- **DarkViolet accent** (`#9400D3`): Primary accent color for interactive elements
- **Surface hierarchy**: Proper use of `base`, `surface0`, `crust` for layout depth
- **Shadcn-Svelte integration**: Theme-compatible component styling throughout

#### Component Patterns

- **Consistent interaction models**: Similar patterns for similar operations across features
- **Progressive disclosure**: Complex features revealed progressively to avoid overwhelming users
- **Accessibility compliance**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly layouts with appropriate touch targets

### Form Handling Philosophy

#### SvelteKit Actions Integration

- **Server-side validation**: Comprehensive validation with structured error reporting
- **Progressive enhancement**: Forms work without JavaScript enabled

```

### Testing Patterns & Lessons Learned

#### SSR vs SPA Testing Evolution

- **Key Insight**: SSR applications require different testing patterns than SPA applications
- **SSR Pattern**: Test actual rendered content, not loading states (data is pre-loaded)
- **Environment Detection**: Use `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST` flag for test data vs real API calls
- **Store Testing**: Test through component integration, not direct store unit tests
- **Form Testing**: Focus on SvelteKit action workflows rather than client-side form state

#### Mock Data Management

- **Structure Consistency**: Mock data must match API response structure exactly
- **Schema Validation**: Use snake_case field names matching backend responses
- **Environment Detection**: Proper test environment detection in `+page.server.ts` files
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Test form functionality without JavaScript enabled

#### Docker Infrastructure Lessons

- **Configuration Reuse**: Leverage existing `docker-compose.dev.yml` patterns
- **Path Resolution**: Use relative paths from frontend directory in global setup
- **Service Dependencies**: Proper health checks and startup ordering
- **Development Mode**: Use development Dockerfiles for E2E testing (includes build tools)

#### Test Performance Optimization

- **Layer Separation**: Fast unit tests for development, comprehensive E2E for validation
- **Parallel Execution**: Backend and frontend tests can run in parallel
- **Docker Caching**: Proper image caching for faster E2E test startup

## SSR Authentication Implementation

**ANALYSIS COMPLETED** - **IMPLEMENTATION PENDING**

### Problem Statement

The SSR migration is fundamentally complete, but authentication remains the critical blocker for full E2E testing:

- **Root Issue**: SSR load functions make authenticated API calls to FastAPI backend but no session handling exists
- **Current Impact**: E2E tests fail because frontend service health checks return 401 responses
- **Technical Gap**: Migration from SPA to SSR completed without implementing server-side authentication

### Authentication Architecture Strategy

#### 1. Session Cookie Management

**SvelteKit Hook Implementation** (`hooks.server.js`):

```javascript
export async function handle({
    event,
    resolve
}) {
    // Extract session cookie from request
    const sessionCookie = event.cookies.get('sessionid');

    // Set user context for load functions
    if (sessionCookie) {
        event.locals.session = sessionCookie;
        event.locals.user = await validateSession(sessionCookie);
    }

    return resolve(event);
}
```

**SSR Load Function Pattern**:

```typescript
export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ cookies, locals }) => {
    // Use session from hooks.server.js
    const sessionCookie = cookies.get('sessionid') || locals.session;

    if (!sessionCookie) {
        throw redirect(302, '/login');
    }

    try {
        const response = await serverApi.get('/api/v1/web/campaigns/', {
            headers: {
                'Cookie': `sessionid=${sessionCookie}`,
                'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'
            }
        });
        return { campaigns: response.data };
    } catch (error) {
        if (error.response?.status === 401) {
            throw redirect(302, '/login');
        }
        throw error(500, 'Failed to load data');
    }
};
```

#### 2. Server-Side API Client

**Authenticated Request Handling**:

```typescript
export class ServerApiClient {
    async authenticatedRequest(
        endpoint: string,
        options: RequestInit,
        cookies: Cookies
    ) {
        const sessionCookie = cookies.get('sessionid');

        if (!sessionCookie) {
            throw new Error('No session cookie found');
        }

        return fetch(`${this.baseURL}${endpoint}`, {
            ...options,
            headers: {
                ...options.headers,
                'Cookie': `sessionid=${sessionCookie}`,
                'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'
            }
        });
    }
}
```

#### 3. Login Form Integration

**SvelteKit Action-Based Login**:

```typescript
export const actions: Actions = {
    default: async ({ request, cookies }) => {
        const form = await superValidate(request, zod(loginSchema));

        if (!form.valid) {
            return fail(400, { form });
        }

        try {
            const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/v1/web/auth/login`, {
                method: 'POST',
                headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
                body: JSON.stringify(form.data)
            });

            if (!response.ok) {
                return fail(401, { form, message: 'Invalid credentials' });
            }

            // Extract and set session cookie
            const setCookieHeader = response.headers.get('set-cookie');
            const sessionMatch = setCookieHeader?.match(/sessionid=([^;]+)/);

            if (sessionMatch) {
                cookies.set('sessionid', sessionMatch[1], {
                    httpOnly: true,
                    secure: true,
                    sameSite: 'strict',
                    maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 // 7 days
                });
            }

            throw redirect(303, '/');
        } catch (error) {
            return fail(500, { form, message: 'Login failed' });
        }
    }
};
```

### Test Environment Integration

#### Environment Detection Pattern

```typescript
export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ cookies }) => {
    // Bypass authentication in test environments
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test' ||
        process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_TEST ||
        process.env.CI) {
        return {
            campaigns: mockCampaignData,
            user: mockUserData
        };
    }

    // Normal authentication flow
    return authenticatedLoad(cookies);
};
```

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Authentication Setup

- [ ] Create `hooks.server.js` for session handling
- [ ] Implement server-side API client with cookie management
- [ ] Create login/logout routes with proper form actions
- [ ] Update environment configuration for API endpoints

#### Phase 2: Load Function Updates

- [ ] Update all `+page.server.ts` files to use authenticated API calls
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for 401/403 responses
- [ ] Add test environment detection for E2E tests
- [ ] Ensure cookie forwarding in all API requests

#### Phase 3: Testing Integration

- [ ] Update E2E seed data to include user sessions
- [ ] Modify Docker health checks to use authenticated endpoints
- [ ] Implement login flow in E2E tests
- [ ] Test session persistence across page navigation

### FastAPI Backend Requirements

#### Session Endpoint Compatibility

Backend must support:

- Session-based authentication (not just JWT)
- Cookie-based session management
- Proper CORS configuration for SvelteKit frontend
- Health check endpoints that work without authentication

#### Required Backend Implementation

```python
@app.post("/api/v1/web/auth/login")
async def login(credentials: LoginRequest, response: Response):
    user = authenticate_user(credentials.email, credentials.password)
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(401, "Invalid credentials")

    session_id = create_user_session(user.id)

    response.set_cookie(
        "sessionid", session_id, httponly=True, secure=True, samesite="strict"
    )

    return {"success": True, "user": user}
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All SSR load functions can make authenticated API calls
- [ ] E2E tests pass with Docker backend authentication
- [ ] Session persistence works across page navigation
- [ ] Proper login/logout flow implemented
- [ ] Test environment detection bypasses authentication
- [ ] Health checks work without breaking Docker startup

### Current Blockers

1. **Authentication Method**: Need to determine if FastAPI backend should implement session-based auth or modify approach
2. **CORS Configuration**: Ensure proper CORS setup for cookie-based authentication
3. **Health Check Strategy**: Implement unauthenticated health endpoints for Docker startup
4. **E2E Test Flow**: Design proper login sequence for E2E test scenarios

### Documentation Update

- [ ] Update the architecture documentation to reflect the decoupled SvelteKit SSR + FastAPI architecture (found in `docs/architecture/*.md`)
- [ ] Update the API reference documentation for SSR integration patterns and server-side data loading (found in `docs/api/overview.md` and `docs/development/api-reference.md`)
- [ ] Update the user guide with new UI workflows, form patterns, and screenshots from e2e tests (found in `docs/user-guide/*.md`)
- [ ] Update the developer guide with SvelteKit SSR development patterns, Docker usage, and testing architecture (found in `docs/development/*.md`)
- [ ] Update the getting started guide with new decoupled service setup instructions and screenshots (found in `docs/getting-started/*.md`)
- [ ] Update the troubleshooting guide for SvelteKit SSR and Docker-specific issues (found in `docs/user-guide/troubleshooting.md`)
- [ ] Update the FAQ for new SSR, form handling, and Docker-related questions (found in `docs/user-guide/faq.md`)

> **Infrastructure Success**: The three-tier testing architecture provides a solid foundation for development confidence. Layer 1 and Layer 2 are fully operational with excellent test coverage. Layer 3 infrastructure is complete and ready for authentication implementation to enable full-stack E2E testing.
