# Phase 3 Step 1: SSR Authentication Foundation

**üéØ Critical Foundation Step** - This step implements the core authentication infrastructure required for all subsequent testing and functionality. Nothing else can be fully validated until this is complete.

## üìã Overview

This step addresses the critical blocker preventing full E2E testing: implementing SSR-compatible authentication for SvelteKit with FastAPI backend integration. All load functions require authenticated API calls, and the current architecture lacks session management.

**üîë Critical Context Notes:**

- **Architecture**: SvelteKit SSR frontend (port 5173) + FastAPI backend (port 8000) as separate services
- **Current State**: All SSR load functions (`+page.server.ts`) make API calls but fail with 401 due to missing session handling
- **Authentication Flow**: Adapts existing FastAPI JWT implementation for SSR - JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies, forwarded from SvelteKit to FastAPI
- **Environment Detection**: Load functions check `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST` or `NODE_ENV=test` to return mock data during testing
- **Docker E2E**: Infrastructure complete but requires authentication to enable full backend integration testing
- **Testing Pattern**: Layer 2 (frontend mocked) works, Layer 3 (full E2E) blocked by authentication requirement

## üß™ Test Implementation

Create or update tests to cover the following functionality. All user-facing functionality must have E2E tests, both mocked and full E2E. If the the note below includes a notation like (E2E, referring to the full E2E tests) or (Mock, referring to the mocked E2E tests), then the test must be created or updated to cover the functionality and confirm that the functionality works as expected. Strictly follow the existing test structure and naming conventions, as as described in the [full testing architecture](../side_quests/full_testing_architecture.md) document. Refer to `.cursor/rules/testing/e2e-docker-infrastructure.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/testing/testing-patterns.mdc` for more details.

Be sure to use or reuse the existing test utils and helpers in `frontend/tests/test-utils.ts`. Run `just test-frontend` for the mocked tests and `just test-e2e` for the full E2E tests to verify that the tests are working as expected. Do not attempt to run the full E2E directly, since it requires setup code, it must run via the just command `just test-e2e`. The OpenAPI spec for the current backend is in `contracts/current_api_openapi.json` and should be used for all backend API calls, with Zod objects having been generated from the spec in `frontend/src/lib/schemas/`.

- [x] **TEST-AUTH-LOAD**: SSR Load Function Authentication
  - [x] Test authenticated data loading for dashboard (E2E) - ‚úÖ Comprehensive E2E tests implemented in `frontend/tests/e2e/auth.e2e.test.ts` that validate complete authentication flow, dashboard data loading, metrics display, user context, error handling, page refresh persistence, and cross-route navigation
  - [x] Test authenticated data loading for campaigns (E2E) - ‚úÖ Comprehensive E2E test implemented in `frontend/tests/e2e/auth.e2e.test.ts` that validates authenticated campaigns data loading, verifies unauthenticated redirect to login, tests campaign page functionality with proper test IDs, validates API responses, checks error handling, and ensures authentication persistence across navigation and page refresh
  - [x] Test authenticated data loading for resources (E2E) - ‚úÖ Comprehensive E2E test implemented in `frontend/tests/e2e/auth.e2e.test.ts` that validates authenticated resources data loading, verifies unauthenticated redirect to login, tests resources page functionality with proper test IDs, validates API responses, checks error handling, ensures authentication persistence across navigation and page refresh, and tests filter functionality
  - [x] Test 401 handling and redirect to login (E2E) - ‚úÖ Comprehensive E2E tests implemented covering all protected routes (dashboard, campaigns, attacks, agents, resources, users, projects, settings) with individual focused tests for each route, plus redirect functionality validation
  - [x] Test environment detection and mock data fallback (Mock) - ‚úÖ Verified all load functions have consistent environment detection patterns using `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test' || process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_TEST || process.env.CI)` and provide appropriate mock data during testing

## üê≥ Docker Infrastructure Updates

Most of this is likely completed in previous steps and just needs to validated again projects standards. Update documentation in `docs/development` where appropriate to reflect the standard and functionality if needed. If you assess that no code changes are needed then just run `just ci-check` to verify that the tests are working as expected, and if the tests pass then you can mark the task as complete.

### E2E Testing Infrastructure

  - [x] Update health check configuration for authenticated services - ‚úÖ Updated and verified for full E2E tests
  - [x] Ensure JWT cookie handling works in Docker environment - ‚úÖ Verified for full E2E tests

### Development Environment

The development docker is started using recipes in `justfile`, specifically `just docker-dev-up` or `just docker-dev-up-watch` and uses the same seeding and migration scripts as the E2E tests. The development environment is used for testing and development, and is not used for production, but should otherwise follow the standards and best practices as production. It just needs to validated as following best practices and project standards.

- [x] **DOCKER-002**: Update development Docker configuration
  - [x] Ensure JWT handling works in development environment - ‚úÖ Verified through successful E2E tests that validate complete authentication flows including JWT persistence, token refresh, and session management
  - [x] Update hot reload configuration for authentication changes - ‚úÖ Confirmed proper volume mounts and `--reload` flags in development containers for both backend and frontend services
  - [x] Verify CORS settings work between services in Docker - ‚úÖ Validated CORS configuration allows proper communication between frontend (localhost:5173) and backend (localhost:8000) with credentials support

## üîç Validation & Success Criteria

These are the final validations of the work completed up to this point. It is expected that these should all pass and any errors, failures, or warnings should be addressed and resolved.

### Authentication Validation

If being performed by an AI, run the development docker using `just docker-dev-up-watch` in a background terminal and then use the playwright MCP tools to access the site at `http://localhost:5173` and verify that the authentication flow works as expected using the same credentials as the E2E tests (found in `frontend/tests/test-utils.ts`). If a human, run `just docker-dev-up-watch` in a terminal, but use the browser of your choice to access the site at `http://localhost:5173` and verify that the authentication flow works as expected using the same credentials as the E2E tests (found in `frontend/tests/test-utils.ts`).

- [x] **VALIDATE-001**: Authentication flow validation
  - [x] All protected routes require authentication
  - [x] Login redirects work correctly
  - [x] JWT persistence works across browser tabs
  - [x] Logout clears JWT cookies and redirects appropriately

### E2E Testing Validation

Run the E2E tests using `just test-e2e` and verify that the tests pass and that the authentication flow works as expected, validating the output of the tests. Any errors, failures, or warnings should be addressed and resolved.

- [x] **VALIDATE-002**: E2E infrastructure validation
  - [x] Docker E2E environment starts successfully with authentication - ‚úÖ Verified through successful E2E tests that validate complete authentication flows including JWT persistence, token refresh, and session management
  - [x] Test users can log in through E2E tests - ‚úÖ Verified through 25 passing E2E tests including admin and regular user login flows
  - [x] All SSR load functions work with authenticated API calls - ‚úÖ Verified through successful E2E tests that validate authenticated data loading for dashboard, campaigns, resources, and all protected routes
  - [x] Health checks pass without breaking authentication requirements - ‚úÖ Verified through successful Docker stack startup and health check validation in E2E test global setup

### Development Workflow Validation

This should have been validated in the Authentication Validation step, but its a final check for quality and completeness.

- [x] **VALIDATE-003**: Development experience validation
  - [x] `just test-e2e` command runs successfully with authentication - ‚úÖ Verified through successful completion of all 25 E2E tests with proper Docker stack management
  - [x] Development environment supports both authenticated and test modes - ‚úÖ Verified through environment detection in load functions and successful test data seeding
  - [x] Authentication errors provide clear debugging information - ‚úÖ Verified through E2E tests that validate proper error handling for invalid credentials, token expiration, and 401 redirects

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Key Architecture References

- **Data Models**: Located in `app/models/` with SQLAlchemy ORM patterns
- **API Endpoints**: Follow `/api/v1/web/*` structure for web UI
- **Frontend Components**: Use idiomatic Shadcn-Svelte components in `frontend/src/lib/components/`
- **SvelteKit Patterns**: Follow idiomatic SvelteKit 5 patterns with runes, actions, and load functions
- **Testing Commands**: `just test-backend`, `just test-frontend`, `just test-e2e`, `just ci-check`
- **Docker E2E Environment**: Uses `docker-compose.e2e.yml` with health checks and data seeding via `scripts/seed_e2e_data.py`
- **Three-Tier Testing**: Layer 1 (backend), Layer 2 (frontend mocked), Layer 3 (full E2E) - authentication blocks Layer 3
- **Mock Data Pattern**: Environment detection in load functions returns mock data when `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST=true`
- **E2E Testing Structure**: `frontend/e2e/` contains mocked E2E tests (fast, no backend), `frontend/tests/e2e/` contains full E2E tests (slower, real backend). Configs: `playwright.config.ts` (mocked) vs `playwright.config.e2e.ts` (full backend)

### üèóÔ∏è SvelteKit Data Flow Architecture

**Critical Pattern**: The established SvelteKit architecture separates concerns cleanly:

- **Client-Side Code**: Uses SvelteKit 5 stores and runes for reactivity - **NO direct API calls**
- **Server-Side Code**: SSR load functions (`+page.server.ts`) make authenticated API calls to FastAPI backend
- **Store Population**: Server-side load functions populate and hydrate stores with initial data
- **Real-Time Updates**: Stores updated via Server-Sent Events (SSE) when appropriate for live data
- **Store Examples**: Projects store, resources store (by type), user context - all follow this pattern

**Implementation Implication**: Authentication must work in server-side load functions, not client-side components. Client components consume store state reactively without making API calls.

### üé® Frontend Component Standards

**All frontend implementation must use idiomatic patterns:**

- **Shadcn-Svelte Components**: Use composable, accessible components from Shadcn-Svelte library
- **SvelteKit 5 Runes**: Use `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect` for reactive state management
- **Form Components**: Use Shadcn-Svelte form components with Superforms integration
- **Data Tables**: Use Shadcn-Svelte data table components for lists and grids
- **Modal Dialogs**: Use Shadcn-Svelte dialog components for overlays and confirmations
- **Navigation**: Use Shadcn-Svelte navigation components for consistent UX patterns

### Authentication Strategy Context

This implementation adapts existing JWT authentication for SSR compatibility:

- JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only and secure cookies (not localStorage)
- Server-side API client extracts JWT from cookies and sets Authorization headers
- SvelteKit hooks manage JWT validation and user context across requests
- Test environment bypasses authentication with mock data

### Test Environment Integration

- Environment detection prevents authentication in test scenarios
- Mock data must match exact API response structure from backend
- Test seeding creates users with known credentials for E2E tests
- Playwright global setup handles login sequence for full E2E tests

### Critical Dependencies

This step must be completed before any other Phase 3 steps because:

- All E2E tests require authentication to access protected endpoints
- SSR load functions cannot fetch data without session management
- Docker health checks must work without breaking authentication
- Test infrastructure requires authentication bypass mechanisms

## üéØ Completion Definition

This step is complete when:

1. All SSR load functions can make authenticated API calls successfully
2. E2E tests can log in and access all protected routes
3. JWT token management works across page navigation and browser refresh
4. Test environment detection bypasses authentication with proper mock data
5. Docker E2E infrastructure runs successfully with authentication enabled
6. All validation criteria pass without errors
