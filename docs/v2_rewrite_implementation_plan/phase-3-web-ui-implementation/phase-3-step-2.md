**🎯 Foundation Verification Step** - This step verifies existing implementations work with authentication and completes core user management features that were identified as incomplete.

## Overview

With authentication implemented in [Step 1](./phase-3-step-1.md), this step focuses on verifying all existing implementations work correctly with authenticated APIs and completing the core user management functionality that currently has empty placeholder files.

### Critical Context Notes

- **Verification Focus**: All existing SvelteKit components and SSR load functions must work with authenticated API calls
- **User Management Gap**: Files `frontend/e2e/settings.test.ts` and `frontend/e2e/users.test.ts` are currently empty placeholders
- **Missing Routes**: User detail (`/users/[id]`) and deletion (`/users/[id]/delete`) pages need implementation
- **Project Context**: Project switching functionality affects all data visibility and requires proper context management
- **Role-Based Access**: UI must distinguish between admin-only and user functions with proper permission enforcement. Permissions must be enforced in the backend (using `casbin` in `app/core/authz.py`) and frontend (within the SvelteKit server load functions).
- **Testing Strategy**: Both Mock tests (UI behavior) and E2E tests (authentication flows) required for each feature; tests should be identical in functionality tested. Follow the [full testing architecture](../side_quests/full_testing_architecture.md) document and refer to `.cursor/rules/testing/e2e-docker-infrastructure.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/testing/testing-patterns.mdc` for detailed guidelines.
- **Component Architecture**: Uses Shadcn-Svelte components with Superforms for form handling and SvelteKit actions

## Verification Tasks (Existing Implementations)

Each of the following elements have been implemented in some capacity and with varying degrees of completeness. The goal of this step is to verify that the existing implementations work correctly with authentication and are consistent with the project's architecture and standards. Ensure idiomatic Shadcn-Svelte components are used for all UI elements. Ensure that SvelteKit 5 patterns are used for client-side and server-side code. Maximize code reuse and consistency across the application.

Verify the functionality through direct observation of the application and the output of the tests. Any errors, failures, or warnings should be addressed and resolved. If you are being performed by an AI, run the development docker using `just docker-dev-up-watch` in a background terminal and then use the playwright MCP tools to access the site at `http://localhost:5173` and verify that the functionality works as expected. If a human, run `just docker-dev-up-watch` in a terminal, but use the browser of your choice to access the site at `http://localhost:5173` and verify that the functionality works as expected.

### Dashboard & Layout Verification

## Core Functionality Test Implementation

The items below represent task items that were either implemented or verified in the previous steps. Now we need to implement proper automated E2E tests to continue to verify that the functionality works as expected. Refer to the [full testing architecture](../side_quests/full_testing_architecture.md) document for more details on the testing architecture and the test structure and verification items above for the associated tasks being tested. In cases where the test is for full E2E (denoted by (E2E) in the test structure), there may be a similar mocked test that can copied and modified to create the full E2E test.

### Testing Guidelines & Requirements

**🧪 Critical Testing Context:**

- **Test Structure**: All user-facing functionality must have both E2E tests (mocked and full E2E). Strictly follow existing test structure and naming conventions as described in the [full testing architecture](../side_quests/full_testing_architecture.md) document.
- **Test Execution**:
    - Run `just test-frontend` for mocked E2E tests (fast, no backend required)
    - Run `just test-e2e` for full E2E tests (requires Docker setup, slower but complete integration testing)
    - **Important**: Do not run full E2E tests directly - they require setup code and must run via the `just test-e2e` command
- **Test Utilities**: Use or reuse existing test utils and helpers in `frontend/tests/test-utils.ts` for consistency and maintainability
- **API Integration**: The OpenAPI spec for the current backend is in `contracts/current_api_openapi.json` and should be used for all backend API calls, with Zod objects generated from the spec in `frontend/src/lib/schemas/`
- **Test Notation**: When tasks include notations like (E2E) or (Mock), tests must be created or updated to cover that specific functionality and confirm it works as expected

## Basic Access Control Implementation

All functionality is to be developed using SvelteKit 5 patterns and idiomatic Shadcn-Svelte components. All forms must use Superforms v2 with SvelteKit actions, Zod validation, and Shadcn-Svelte form components. All forms must be validated on the server side and client side. All forms must be validated using the OpenAPI spec in `contracts/current_api_openapi.json` and the Zod objects in `frontend/src/lib/schemas/`. All forms must be validated using the OpenAPI spec in `contracts/current_api_openapi.json` and the Zod objects in `frontend/src/lib/schemas/`. All forms must be validated using the OpenAPI spec in `contracts/current_api_openapi.json` and the Zod objects in `frontend/src/lib/schemas/`.

Verify the functionality through direct observation of the application and the output of the tests. Any errors, failures, or warnings should be addressed and resolved. If you are being performed by an AI, run the development docker using `just docker-dev-up-watch` in a background terminal and then use the playwright MCP tools to access the site at `http://localhost:5173` and verify that the functionality works as expected. If a human, run `just docker-dev-up-watch` in a terminal, but use the browser of your choice to access the site at `http://localhost:5173` and verify that the functionality works as expected.

## UI Polish Tasks

### Layout and Responsive Design

- [ ] **POLISH-001**: Complete layout implementation
    - [ ] Modal overlay and z-index management (`UIX-001d`)
    - [ ] Mobile navigation menu (`UIX-001b`) - Suffice to have a hamburger menu that opens a drawer with the sidebar content
    - [ ] Responsive design validation across viewports

### Theme Implementation

**Style Guide**: Use the Catppuccin Macchiato theme (with DarkViolet as the accent color) in dark mode and the Catppuccin Latte theme in light mode. Refer to the [style guide](../development/style-guide.md) for more specifics.

- [ ] **POLISH-002**: Consistent styling
    - [ ] Dark mode toggle functionality (`UIX-001e`) - Use the NightModeToggleButton component with default dark mode - See [Shadcn Svelte Dark Mode](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/dark-mode/svelte) for more details.
    - [ ] Theme switching without page refresh (`UIX-004b`)
    - [ ] Theme preference persistence across sessions (`UIX-004c`)
    - [ ] Catppuccin theme consistency (`UIX-004d`)
    - [ ] System theme detection and auto-switching (`UIX-004f`) - use `mode-watcher` to detect system theme and auto-switch to the correct theme. See [Shadcn Svelte Dark Mode](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/dark-mode/svelte) for more details.

## Validation & Success Criteria

    - [ ] Dashboard loads and displays data correctly
    - [ ] Campaign, attack, resource, and agent management functional
    - [ ] Forms submit successfully with proper validation
    - [ ] Navigation works across all sections

    - [ ] All tests pass in both Mock and E2E environments
    - [ ] Performance is acceptable for core workflows

## Implementation Notes

### Key Implementation Patterns

- **Component Architecture**: Use idiomatic Shadcn-Svelte components with proper composition and accessibility
- **SvelteKit Patterns**: Follow idiomatic SvelteKit 5 patterns with runes ($state, $derived, $effect), actions, and load functions
- **Form Handling**: All forms use Superforms v2 with SvelteKit actions, Zod validation, and Shadcn-Svelte form components
- **SSR Load Functions**: Located in `+page.server.ts` files, handle authenticated API calls and error states
- **Role-Based UI**: Use `$page.data.user.role` for conditional rendering of admin-only features
- **Project Context**: Access via `$page.data.project` and update with project switching functionality
- **Error Handling**: 401 redirects to login, 404 shows error page, 500 logs and shows generic error
- **Environment Detection**: Check `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST` or `NODE_ENV=test` for mock data fallbacks
- **E2E Testing Structure**: `frontend/e2e/` contains mocked E2E tests (fast, no backend), `frontend/tests/e2e/` contains full E2E tests (slower, real backend). Configs: `playwright.config.ts` (mocked) vs `playwright.config.e2e.ts` (full backend)

### UI/UX Requirements & Standards

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the interface is polished and follows project standards. While mobile support is not a priority, it should be functional and usable on modern desktop browsers and tablets from `1080x720` resolution on up. It is reasonable to develop for support of mobile resolutions.
- **Offline Capability**: Ability to operate entirely without internet connectivity is a priority. No functionality should depend on public CDNs or other internet-based services.
- **API Integration**: The OpenAPI spec for the current backend is in `contracts/current_api_openapi.json` and should be used for all backend API calls, with Zod objects having been generated from the spec in `frontend/src/lib/schemas/`.
- **Testing Coverage**: All forms must be validated using the OpenAPI spec and the Zod objects. All forms must be validated on both server side and client side.

### Priority Focus

This step prioritizes:

1. Verifying existing implementations work with authentication
2. Completing the user management gap (empty test files)
3. Implementing basic access control patterns
4. Establishing solid test coverage for core features

### Test Implementation Strategy

- Mock tests focus on UI behavior and validation
- E2E tests focus on authentication flows and data persistence
- Both test types should be implemented for critical user workflows
- Environment detection ensures tests work in all scenarios

### User Management Context

User management was identified as a major gap with empty placeholder files. This step completes:

- Settings page functionality (`settings.test.ts`)
- User management workflows (`users.test.ts`)
- User detail and deletion pages
- Project selection and switching

## Completion Definition

This step is complete when:

1. All existing implementations verified to work with authentication
2. User management functionality fully implemented and tested
3. Basic access control patterns implemented across the application
4. Core functionality test coverage is comprehensive (Mock + E2E)
5. Theme system and responsive design are functional
6. All validation criteria pass without errors
