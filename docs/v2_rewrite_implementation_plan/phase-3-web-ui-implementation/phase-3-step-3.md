# Phase 3 Step 3: Advanced Features & Real-Time Capabilities

**üéØ Advanced Features Step** - This step implements real-time capabilities, completes advanced attack features, and finishes resource management functionality.

## üìã Overview

With core functionality verified and user management complete, this step focuses on advanced features that enhance the user experience: real-time updates via SSE, advanced attack configuration options, complete resource management workflows, and enhanced campaign operations.

**üîë Critical Context Notes:**

- **SSE Architecture**: Server-Sent Events provide lightweight trigger notifications (not full data streaming) for real-time updates
- **Attack Editor Context**: Dictionary attacks support ephemeral wordlists, mask attacks create one-time mask lists, brute force is a UI wrapper for incremental masks
- **Resource Management**: Upload page supports file drop zones, inline editing for small files, and atomic operations to prevent orphaned data
- **Hash List Integration**: Crackable uploads support dual input modes (file upload + text paste) with intelligent hash type detection
- **Real-time Features**: Toast notifications batch rapid events, SSE connections handle reconnection, project-scoped filtering prevents data leaks
- **Campaign Operations**: Export/import uses JSON schema with GUID-based resource references, lifecycle operations include start/pause/resume/stop
- **Performance Requirements**: Live keyspace estimation via `/api/v1/web/attacks/estimate`, real-time progress tracking without performance impact
- **Testing Strategy**: All user-facing functionality must have both E2E tests (mocked and full E2E). Follow the [full testing architecture](../side_quests/full_testing_architecture.md) document and refer to `.cursor/rules/testing/e2e-docker-infrastructure.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/testing/testing-patterns.mdc` for detailed guidelines.
- **E2E Testing Structure**: `frontend/e2e/` contains mocked E2E tests (fast, no backend), `frontend/tests/e2e/` contains full E2E tests (slower, real backend). Configs: `playwright.config.ts` (mocked) vs `playwright.config.e2e.ts` (full backend)

## üß™ Advanced Features Testing

### Testing Guidelines & Requirements

**üß™ Critical Testing Context:**

- **Test Structure**: All user-facing functionality must have both E2E tests (mocked and full E2E). Strictly follow existing test structure and naming conventions as described in the [full testing architecture](../side_quests/full_testing_architecture.md) document.
- **Test Execution**:
    - Run `just test-frontend` for mocked E2E tests (fast, no backend required)
    - Run `just test-e2e` for full E2E tests (requires Docker setup, slower but complete integration testing)
    - **Important**: Do not run full E2E tests directly - they require setup code and must run via the `just test-e2e` command
- **Test Utilities**: Use or reuse existing test utils and helpers in `frontend/tests/test-utils.ts` for consistency and maintainability
- **API Integration**: The OpenAPI spec for the current backend is in `contracts/current_api_openapi.json` and should be used for all backend API calls, with Zod objects generated from the spec in `frontend/src/lib/schemas/`
- **Test Notation**: When tasks include notations like (E2E) or (Mock), tests must be created or updated to cover that specific functionality and confirm it works as expected

### UI/UX Requirements & Standards

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the interface is polished and follows project standards. While mobile support is not a priority, it should be functional and usable on modern desktop browsers and tablets from `1080x720` resolution on up. It is reasonable to develop for support of mobile resolutions.
- **Offline Capability**: Ability to operate entirely without internet connectivity is a priority. No functionality should depend on public CDNs or other internet-based services.
- **API Integration**: The OpenAPI spec for the current backend is in `contracts/current_api_openapi.json` and should be used for all backend API calls, with Zod objects having been generated from the spec in `frontend/src/lib/schemas/`.
- **Testing Coverage**: All forms must be validated using the OpenAPI spec and the Zod objects. All forms must be validated on both server side and client side.

### Key Technical Patterns

- **Component Architecture**: Use idiomatic Shadcn-Svelte components for all UI elements with proper accessibility and theming
- **SvelteKit Integration**: Follow idiomatic SvelteKit 5 patterns for real-time updates, form handling, and state management
- **SSE Implementation**: Use EventSource API with `/api/v1/web/live/*` endpoints for targeted component updates
- **Attack Editor Flow**: Dictionary ‚Üí searchable dropdowns, Mask ‚Üí ephemeral lists, Brute Force ‚Üí UI wrapper for incremental masks
- **Resource Upload**: FileDropZone from Shadcn-Svelte-Extra, presigned URLs, atomic operations, progress tracking
- **Hash Detection**: Multi-stage validation, confidence scoring, manual override capability, shadow file parsing
- **Campaign Export**: JSON schema with GUID references, versioned imports, ephemeral resource rehydration
- **Performance Optimization**: Real-time keyspace calculation, live complexity estimation, minimal data transfer

### Real-Time Implementation Strategy

Real-time features use lightweight trigger notifications rather than full data streaming:

- SSE sends minimal event data to trigger component refreshes
- Components refetch data using existing API endpoints
- Project-scoped filtering prevents data leaks between projects
- Connection management handles reconnection and cleanup

### Advanced Attack Features Context

These features enhance the attack configuration experience:

- Rule modificators provide power users with advanced capabilities
- Dynamic wordlists improve attack efficiency using project history
- Overlap detection prevents wasted computational resources
- Performance estimation helps users plan attack sequences

### Resource Management Enhancement

Complete resource management addresses identified gaps:

- Upload page provides comprehensive file handling capabilities
- Content editing enables in-place modification of resources
- Detail pages centralize all resource-related information
- Usage tracking prevents accidental deletion of active resources

## üéØ Completion Definition

This step is complete when:

1. Real-time updates work correctly across all components via SSE
2. Toast notification system provides comprehensive user feedback
3. Advanced attack features enhance configuration capabilities
4. Resource management provides complete upload, edit, and detail workflows
5. Hash list management handles all upload and campaign integration scenarios
6. All advanced features have comprehensive test coverage (Mock + E2E)
7. Performance is acceptable for all real-time and advanced features
