## Overview

With advanced features implemented, this step focuses on completing agent management capabilities and ensuring all components work together seamlessly through comprehensive integration testing and workflow validation.

### Critical Context Notes

- **Agent Architecture**: Agents report via `DeviceStatus`, `TaskStatus`, and `HashcatGuess` objects from `contracts/v1_api_swagger.json` specification
- **Agent Details Modal**: 5-tab interface (Settings, Hardware, Performance, Log, Capabilities) with admin-only access controls
- **Hardware Management**: Backend devices from `--backend-info`, stored as `Agent.devices` list and `backend_device` comma-separated integers
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time charts using `DeviceStatus.speed` over 8-hour windows, donut charts for utilization
- **Benchmark System**: `HashcatBenchmark` model with hash_type_id, runtime, hash_speed, device fields; supports `--benchmark-all` vs `--benchmark`
- **Integration Workflows**: End-to-end campaign creation to execution, resource upload to attack usage, agent registration to task assignment
- **Error Recovery**: Network failure handling, large file upload resumption, concurrent user modification resolution
- **Cross-Component Testing**: Full workflows must work across campaigns, attacks, resources, agents, and users with proper permissions
- **Testing Strategy**: All user-facing functionality must have both E2E tests (mocked and full E2E). Follow the [full testing architecture](../side_quests/full_testing_architecture.md) document and refer to `.cursor/rules/testing/e2e-docker-infrastructure.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/testing/testing-patterns.mdc` for detailed guidelines.
- **E2E Testing Structure**: `frontend/e2e/` contains mocked E2E tests (fast, no backend), `frontend/tests/e2e/` contains full E2E tests (slower, real backend). Configs: `playwright.config.ts` (mocked) vs `playwright.config.e2e.ts` (full backend)

## Agent Management Testing

### Testing Guidelines & Requirements

**ðŸ§ª Critical Testing Context:**

- **Test Structure**: All user-facing functionality must have both E2E tests (mocked and full E2E). Strictly follow existing test structure and naming conventions as described in the [full testing architecture](../side_quests/full_testing_architecture.md) document.
- **Test Execution**:
  - Run `just test-frontend` for mocked E2E tests (fast, no backend required)
  - Run `just test-e2e` for full E2E tests (requires Docker setup, slower but complete integration testing)
  - **Important**: Do not run full E2E tests directly - they require setup code and must run via the `just test-e2e` command
- **Test Utilities**: Use or reuse existing test utils and helpers in `frontend/tests/test-utils.ts` for consistency and maintainability
- **API Integration**: The OpenAPI spec for the current backend is in `contracts/current_api_openapi.json` and should be used for all backend API calls, with Zod objects generated from the spec in `frontend/src/lib/schemas/`
- **Test Notation**: When tasks include notations like (E2E) or (Mock), tests must be created or updated to cover that specific functionality and confirm it works as expected

### UI/UX Requirements & Standards

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the interface is polished and follows project standards. While mobile support is not a priority, it should be functional and usable on modern desktop browsers and tablets from `1080x720` resolution on up. It is reasonable to develop for support of mobile resolutions.
- **Offline Capability**: Ability to operate entirely without internet connectivity is a priority. No functionality should depend on public CDNs or other internet-based services.
- **API Integration**: The OpenAPI spec for the current backend is in `contracts/current_api_openapi.json` and should be used for all backend API calls, with Zod objects having been generated from the spec in `frontend/src/lib/schemas/`.
- **Testing Coverage**: All forms must be validated using the OpenAPI spec and the Zod objects. All forms must be validated on both server side and client side.
