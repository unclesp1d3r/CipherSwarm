- **Audit System**: Comprehensive logging of user actions, system events, and security events with filtering, search, and export capabilities
- **Administrative Features**: System configuration management, background job monitoring, bulk operations, maintenance mode controls
- **Resource Sensitivity**: Global vs project-scoped visibility, sensitive resource redaction for non-admins, access control validation
- **Fleet Management**: Agent configuration management, performance optimization, workload balancing, utilization analytics

## System Monitoring & Administrative Testing

### Testing Guidelines & Requirements

**🧪 Critical Testing Context:**

- **Test Structure**: All user-facing functionality must have both E2E tests (mocked and full E2E). Strictly follow existing test structure and naming conventions as described in the [full testing architecture](../side_quests/full_testing_architecture.md) document.
- **Test Execution**:
    - Run `just test-frontend` for mocked E2E tests (fast, no backend required)
    - Run `just test-e2e` for full E2E tests (requires Docker setup, slower but complete integration testing)
    - **Important**: Do not run full E2E tests directly - they require setup code and must run via the `just test-e2e` command
- **Test Utilities**: Use or reuse existing test utils and helpers in `frontend/tests/test-utils.ts` for consistency and maintainability
- **API Integration**: The OpenAPI spec for the current backend is in `contracts/current_api_openapi.json` and should be used for all backend API calls, with Zod objects generated from the spec in `frontend/src/lib/schemas/`
- **Test Notation**: When tasks include notations like (E2E) or (Mock), tests must be created or updated to cover that specific functionality and confirm it works as expected

### UI/UX Requirements & Standards

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the interface is polished and follows project standards. While mobile support is not a priority, it should be functional and usable on modern desktop browsers and tablets from `1080x720` resolution on up. It is reasonable to develop for support of mobile resolutions.
- **Offline Capability**: Ability to operate entirely without internet connectivity is a priority. No functionality should depend on public CDNs or other internet-based services.
- **API Integration**: The OpenAPI spec for the current backend is in `contracts/current_api_openapi.json` and should be used for all backend API calls, with Zod objects having been generated from the spec in `frontend/src/lib/schemas/`.
- **Testing Coverage**: All forms must be validated using the OpenAPI spec and the Zod objects. All forms must be validated on both server side and client side.
