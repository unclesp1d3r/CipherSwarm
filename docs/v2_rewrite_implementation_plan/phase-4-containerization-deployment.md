# Phase 4: Containerization and Deployment — TODO

This document outlines the implementation plan for containerizing CipherSwarm and deploying the full stack using Docker and Docker Compose, following CipherSwarm's Docker standards and [FastAPI Docker Best Practices](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/docker/).

---

## Context

- **Goal:** Enable reproducible, secure, and efficient deployment of CipherSwarm using containers.
- **Scope:** FastAPI app, PostgreSQL, MinIO, and Nginx (for production), with optional Redis for caching, with development and production configurations.
- **Critical Standards (from CipherSwarm Docker Guidelines):**
    - **FastAPI Application:**
        - Python 3.13 base image
        - Use `uv` for dependency management
        - Health checks and graceful shutdown
        - Non-root user in container
        - Hot reload for development
    - **PostgreSQL Database:**
        - Version 16 or later
        - Persistent volume mounts
        - Automated backups
    - **Redis Cache (Optional):**
        - Latest stable version
        - Production caching backend (Cashews)
        - Celery task queue backend
        - Development uses in-memory caching
    - **MinIO Object Storage:**
        - Latest stable version
        - Configured buckets for attack resources
        - TLS/SSL support
        - Access key management
    - **Nginx Reverse Proxy (production):**
        - SSL termination
        - Rate limiting
        - Static file serving
    - **Security:**
        - All containers run as non-root
        - Read-only root filesystem where possible
        - Resource limits and quotas
        - Secrets managed via environment files (never in images)
    - **Deployment:**
        - Single-command deployment: `docker compose up -d`
        - Automated DB migrations
        - Health check monitoring
        - Backup and restore procedures
        - Log aggregation and monitoring
        - Zero-downtime updates and rollback
    - **Development Workflow:**
        - Hot reload for development
        - Shared volume mounts for code changes
        - Test environment configuration
        - Debug capabilities
    - **CI/CD Integration:**
        - Automated builds and container testing
        - Security scanning
        - Registry pushes and deployment automation
    - **Backup Strategy:**
        - Database dumps
        - MinIO bucket backups
        - Automated scheduling and retention
    - **Scaling:**
        - Service replication
        - Load balancing
        - Storage expansion
- **Docker Compose Swarm Compatibility:**
    - The `docker-compose.yml` file should be written to support both standard Compose and Docker Swarm stack deployments where feasible. This enables scaling and orchestration via `docker stack deploy` as described in [this article](https://towardsaws.com/deploying-a-docker-stack-across-a-docker-swarm-using-a-docker-compose-file-ddac4c0253da).
    - Use Compose file version 3+, avoid `build` in production, and consider `deploy` keys for Swarm compatibility.
- **Automated Dockerfile Build/Run Testing:**
    - All Dockerfiles (dev and prod) must be automatically built and run-tested as part of CI and the `just ci-check` workflow. This ensures that any changes to Dockerfiles are validated for build success and basic runtime health, preventing broken images from reaching production or development environments.

## Implementation Checklist

### 1. FastAPI Application Dockerfile

- [ ] Create `docker/app/Dockerfile.dev` for development
- [ ] Create `docker/app/Dockerfile.prod` for production
- [ ] Use Python 3.13 base image
- [ ] Install dependencies with `uv`
- [ ] Configure for hot reload in dev
- [ ] Add healthcheck endpoint
- [ ] Run as non-root user
- [ ] Set up graceful shutdown

### 2. Docker Compose Configuration

- [ ] Create `docker-compose.dev.yml` for local development
- [ ] Create `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production
- [ ] Define services: app, db (Postgres 16+), minio, nginx (prod only), redis (optional)
- [ ] Configure persistent volumes for db, minio, redis (if used)
- [ ] Set up environment variables and secrets
- [ ] Add healthcheck and restart policies
- [ ] Mount static and certs for nginx
- [ ] Document usage in README
- [ ] **Endeavor to ensure docker-compose.yml is compatible with Docker Swarm stack deployments** ([see article](https://towardsaws.com/deploying-a-docker-stack-across-a-docker-swarm-using-a-docker-compose-file-ddac4c0253da))

### 3. Database and Resource Management

- [ ] Ensure Postgres uses persistent storage
- [ ] Configure MinIO buckets for resources
- [ ] Add backup/restore hooks for db and MinIO
- [ ] Set up Redis for caching (optional) and Celery task queue

### 4. Security and Best Practices

- [ ] Run all containers as non-root
- [ ] Set resource limits/quotas in compose files
- [ ] Use read-only root filesystem where possible
- [ ] Store secrets in env files, not in images
- [ ] Enable TLS/SSL for MinIO and Nginx (prod)

### 5. CI/CD Workflow Updates

- [ ] Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to build and test Docker images
- [ ] Add `.github/workflows/docker-deploy.yml` for deployment
- [ ] Ensure `just ci-check` runs in containerized environment
- [ ] Automate DB migrations on deploy
- [ ] Add security scanning for images
- [ ] Document CI/CD process
- [ ] **Add automated build and run-test for all Dockerfiles (dev and prod) in CI and justfile**

### 6. Validation and Testing

- [ ] Test local dev stack with `docker compose up`
- [ ] Test production stack with sample data
- [ ] Validate health checks and graceful shutdown
- [ ] Run integration tests in containers
- [ ] Verify backup/restore procedures
- [ ] **Verify Dockerfile build/run tests pass in CI and just ci-check**
