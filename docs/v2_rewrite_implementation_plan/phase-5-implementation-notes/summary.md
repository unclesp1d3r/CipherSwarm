# 🚀 CipherSwarm Phase 5: Master Summary

## 🧭 Mission

Phase 5 transforms CipherSwarm from a high-performance orchestrator into an **adaptive, feedback-driven cracking intelligence system**, with smarter agents, real-time scheduling, dynamic planning, and strategic attack optimization.

---

## 📝 DAG-based Cracking Campaigns

This is the CipherSwarm's effort to implement Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based cracking campaigns. In CipherSwarm’s context, a DAG is used to model the flow of attack phases — where each node represents a cracking strategy (e.g., dictionary+rule, mask, brute-force), and arrows show which phases logically follow others.

### Why a DAG?

- Directed: Attack steps move forward — you don’t re-run prior phases unless explicitly configured.
- Acyclic: No loops — each path flows from start to completion without circling back.
- Graph: Multiple branches can exist in parallel, enabling exploratory or fallback strategies.

## ⚙️ CORE PILLARS

### 1. **Advanced Task Scheduling** [Advanced Task Scheduler](advanced_task_scheduler.md)

- WorkSlice + TaskPlan system based on precomputed keyspace divisions
- Fully supports hybrid, mask, brute-force, and incremental attack types
- Real-time slice leasing with reclaim logic and keyspace coverage tracking
- Agent scoring considers hashrate benchmarks, throttling, and uptime
- Supports crackless watchdogs, thermal-aware scoring, and background task prioritization

### 2. **Agent Sync + Health Framework** [Agent Sync Extensions](agent_sync_extensions.md)

- Backoff Signals: Agents are explicitly told to pause based on system or agent health
- Load Smoothing: Randomized heartbeats and sync intervals to prevent traffic spikes
- Failure Pattern Tracking: Rolling agent reliability scores impact task assignment
- Lease Expiry & Reclaim: TTL-based Redis tracking for automatic task reclamation
- Agent Local Heuristics: Agents throttle themselves based on temp, load, or guessrate

### 3. **Agent Collaboration Model** [Agent-Server Collaboration Vision](agent-server-collaboration-vision.md)

- Structured Status Streaming via `/status` with `--status-json` parsing
- Self-Tuning Agents adjust workload profile (`-w`) and runtime params dynamically
- Offline Recovery: Agents checkpoint slice metadata mid-task; server accepts partial completion
- Live Plan Adjustment: Server adapts slice sizing and prioritization in real time
- Crack Feedback Loop: Successful cracks influence dictionary/rule/mask strategy
- Performance History: Server models agent capabilities per hash type
- Capability Signaling: Agents report hash type support, memory, load
- Optional: Agent Karma, Slice Replay, DAG Auto-Growth

### 4. **Hard Password Attack Intelligence** [Hard Password Attack Strategies](hard_password_attack_strategies.md)

- **Dynamic Wordlists**: Meta-wordlists, frequency sorting, crack-informed candidates
- **Rule Learning & Debug Parsing**: Derive rules from cracked pairs and `--debug-mode=3` - [See Learned Rules Parser Plan](learned_rules_parser_plan.md)
- **Markov Modeling**: Automatic hcstat2 generation per project; opt-in UI toggle - [See Markov Auto-Generation Plan](markov_autogen_plan.md)
- **PACK-Inspired Intelligence**:
  - Internal `maskgen`, `rulegen`, `statsgen`, `policygen` clones
- **Graph-Driven Campaigns**: DAG-style phased attack planning
- **LLM/Trigram Expansion**: AI-inspired password candidate generation
- **Advanced DAG Logic**:

  - Crack origin attribution
  - Entropy bucketing
  - DAG trimming or extension
  - Agent-affinity weighting
  - Hot slice promotion
