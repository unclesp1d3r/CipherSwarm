# Phase 5: Task Distribution System

This phase focuses on distributing attack workloads across available agents in the lab. It includes job scheduling, task generation, campaign-to-attack logic, and real-time synchronization with agent status.

## ✅ Goals

-   Implement campaign execution engine
-   Assign attacks to agents based on priority and availability
-   Track task lifecycle from creation to completion
-   Package and serialize tasks to be sent to agents

## 📦 Implementation Tasks

-   [ ] Implement algorithms for splitting up an attack into tasks based on total keyspace and agent benchmarks
-   [ ] Build a scheduler to:
    -   Sort campaigns by priority
    -   Sort attacks by when campaigns are equal priority
    -   Create tasks from attacks, dividing them up into chunks based on total keyspace and agent benchmarks
    -   Provide tasks to agents upon request
    -   Monitor agent status and reassign tasks if agents become unavailable
    -   Notify agents when they are assigned tasks for an attack that is no longer running
-   [ ] Implement message protocol to dispatch tasks to agents
-   [ ] Track execution state (queued, dispatched, running, completed)
-   [ ] Handle failed tasks with retries or reassignment

## 🔧 Agent Sync

-   [ ] Implement agent polling endpoints (e.g., `/agent/heartbeat`, `/agent/pickup`)
-   [ ] Return task payloads securely
-   [ ] Support pausing or stopping campaigns via web UI

## 🔌 Dependencies

-   Campaigns
-   Agents
-   Attack resources
-   Agent status tracking
