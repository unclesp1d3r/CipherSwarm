# Phase 5: Task Distribution System

This phase focuses on distributing attack workloads across available agents in the lab. It includes job scheduling, task generation, campaign-to-attack logic, and real-time synchronization with agent status.

## âœ… Goals

- Implement campaign execution engine
- Assign attacks to agents based on priority and availability
- Track task lifecycle from creation to completion
- Package and serialize tasks to be sent to agents

## ðŸ“¦ Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Define task and attack schemas
- [ ] Build a scheduler to:
  - Monitor campaign queue
  - Assign work to available agents
  - Prioritize based on user control (power user/admin)
- [ ] Create logic for packaging task into portable payload
- [ ] Implement message protocol to dispatch jobs to agents
- [ ] Track execution state (queued, dispatched, running, completed)
- [ ] Handle failed jobs with retries or reassignment

## ðŸ”§ Agent Sync

- [ ] Implement agent polling endpoints (e.g., `/agent/heartbeat`, `/agent/pickup`)
- [ ] Return task payloads securely
- [ ] Support pausing or stopping campaigns via web UI

## ðŸ”Œ Dependencies

- Campaigns
- Agents
- Attack resources
- Agent status tracking
