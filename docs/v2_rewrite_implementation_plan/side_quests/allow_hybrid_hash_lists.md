## Intent

CipherSwarm v1 (and v2 so far) assumes a single `hash_type_id` per `HashList`, which fails in real-world scenarios like shadow files containing a mixture of bcrypt, yescrypt, and sha512crypt hashes. This change introduces minimal support for mixed-type hashlists by associating the `hash_type_id` with each individual `HashItem`, while preserving the v1 Agent API contract completely.

Agents must still receive a single `Task` with:

- One `hash_mode` field
- One list of matching hashes (as plaintext strings)

This update ensures we issue one Task per hash type, while logically keeping them part of a single unified campaign/attack from the user's perspective.

## Boundaries

- Do **not** change the v1 API schema or behavior
- Do **not** remove or alter `HashList.hash_type_id` yet — it can remain for compatibility
- Do **not** expose mixed-type hashlists in the UI or control API at this stage
- Do **not** attempt to unify or deduplicate across hash types
- Do **not** support multi-mode `Task`s — each task must have exactly one hash mode

---

## Phase 1: Schema + Migration

- [ ] Add `hash_type_id: int` to the `HashItem` model
    - Required field
    - Leave `HashList.hash_type_id` untouched for now
- [ ] Create Alembic migration:
    - Add nullable `hash_type_id` column to `hash_items`
    - Backfill `hash_type_id` on each `HashItem` using its parent `HashList.hash_type_id`
    - Set `NOT NULL` constraint once backfill is complete

---

## Phase 2: Crackable Upload Integration

- [ ] Update hash extraction logic (e.g. in `crackable_upload_pipeline.py`) to:
    - Infer the hash type of each parsed line
    - Create a `HashItem` with a per-line `hash_type_id`
- [ ] If multiple hash types are found:
    - Log per-type count in `UploadResult.metadata.hash_type_breakdown`

    - Example:

        ```json
        {
          "hash_type_breakdown": {
            "1800": 728,
            "3200": 91
          }
        }
        ```

---

## Phase 3: Task Planner Refactor

- [ ] During task generation for an Attack:
    - Group `HashItems` by `hash_type_id`
    - For each group:
        - Create a separate `Task`
        - Set `task.hash_mode = group.hash_type_id`
        - Assign only the matching subset of `HashItems` to that `Task`

---

## Phase 4: Agent Compatibility - Hashlist Download

- [ ] Modify `/api/v1/client/hashlists/{id}/download`:
    - Add required query param: `?hash_mode=<int>`
    - Filter returned `HashItems` to only those with matching `hash_type_id`
    - Output format must remain: `List[str]`, one hash per line
- [ ] Raise `400 Bad Request` if `hash_mode` param is missing or unsupported
- [ ] Add test coverage for:
    - Valid filtering by mode
    - Invalid mode or missing mode param

---

## Phase 5: Tests and Validation

- [ ] Unit test: upload with single and mixed-type hashes → verify per-line `hash_type_id`
- [ ] Integration test: upload → hashlist → campaign → attack → task
    - Verify that each task created references only one `hash_mode`
    - Verify that hash list download returns filtered values
- [ ] Validate that `GET /api/v1/client/tasks/{id}` response:
    - Includes only matching-mode hashes
    - Has correct `hash_mode` field
- [ ] Validate that Agent behavior is **unchanged** (schema match + correct input)

---

## Phase 6: Optional Follow-Up (Do NOT do in this pass)

- [ ] Do not yet remove or deprecate `HashList.hash_type_id`
- [ ] Do not yet expose mixed-type awareness in frontend or control API
