# FastHX Migration Checklist: Template Endpoints

This checklist tracks the migration of all server-rendered template endpoints to FastHX decorators (`@jinja.page`, `@jinja.hx`). See [fasthx rules](.cursor/rules/code/fasthx-guidelines.mdc) for more details.

-   Do not include "Response" in the context data returned from FastHX endpoints, that is not used in FastHX.
-   NEVER use `Any` in the return type of FastHX endpoints.
-   Never use `dict[str, Any]` for the return type of FastHX endpoints, return proper Pydantic models instead.

-   **[x]** = Migrated to FastHX
-   **[ ]** = Not yet migrated

---

## 1. Full-Page Views (`app/web/routes`)

-   [x] `dashboard.py` (`/`)
-   [x] `agents.py` (`/agents`)
-   [x] `campaigns.py` (`/campaigns`)
-   [ ] `tasks.py` (`/tasks`)
-   [ ] `results.py` (`/results`)
-   [ ] `resources.py` (`/resources`)
-   [ ] `settings.py` (`/settings`)
-   [ ] `users.py` (`/users`)
-   [ ] Any other full-page routers

## 2. Partials/Fragments (`app/api/v1/endpoints/web`)

-   [x] `attacks.py` (`/attacks/editor-modal`)
-   [ ] `attacks.py` (all other modal/fragment endpoints)
-   [x] `agents.py` (modal/fragment endpoints)
-   [x] `campaigns.py` (modal/fragment endpoints)
-   [ ] `tasks.py` (modal/fragment endpoints)
-   [ ] `results.py` (modal/fragment endpoints)
-   [x] `resources.py` (modal/fragment endpoints)
-   [ ] `settings.py` (modal/fragment endpoints)
-   [ ] `users.py` (modal/fragment endpoints)
-   [ ] Any other partial/fragment routers

**Instructions:**

-   Check off each endpoint as it is migrated to FastHX.
-   For each migration, ensure:
    -   No use of `response_class=HTMLResponse` or manual `TemplateResponse` in FastHX routes
    -   All context variables are passed as top-level keys unless otherwise required
    -   E2E and integration tests pass after migration
