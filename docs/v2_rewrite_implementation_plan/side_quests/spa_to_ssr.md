# üîÑ SPA to SSR Migration Plan - Task-Based Execution

## üìã Overview

This document outlines the complete migration plan for transitioning CipherSwarm from a static SvelteKit SPA served by FastAPI to a fully decoupled, dynamic SvelteKit application with SSR capabilities.

When in doubt about the implementation, refer to notes in the `docs/v2_rewrite_implementation_plan/notes` directory, as well as the `docs/development/user_journey_flowchart.mmd` file.

**Current State:**

- SvelteKit app using `adapter-static` with `fallback: 'index.html'`  
- FastAPI serves frontend via `StaticFiles` mount at root (`/`)
- Frontend makes API calls using relative paths (`/api/v1/web/*`)
- No SSR, broken deep linking, limited form handling

**Target State:**

- SvelteKit app using `adapter-node` with SSR
- Decoupled frontend server consuming FastAPI as an API service
- Proper environment-based API configuration
- Full SSR, working deep links, SvelteKit form actions with Shadcn-Svelte + Superforms

## üéØ Key Architectural Decision: "Stock Shadcn-Svelte" Approach

**Philosophy:** Leverage Superforms' built-in SvelteKit integration instead of custom API clients.

**Implementation Strategy:**

1. ‚úÖ **Forms use standard SvelteKit form actions** (POST to same route)
2. ‚úÖ **Superforms handles validation & progressive enhancement** (out-of-the-box)
3. ‚úÖ **Server-side conversion** of validated data to CipherSwarm API format
4. ‚úÖ **Components stay close to stock Shadcn-Svelte** patterns for maintainability

**Benefits:**

- Minimal custom code to maintain
- Maximum compatibility with Shadcn-Svelte ecosystem updates
- Progressive enhancement works automatically
- Clean separation between form concerns and API concerns

## üìù TASK EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup

#### 1.1 Update Dependencies and Configuration

- [x] **Update SvelteKit Adapter** `task_id: setup.adapter_update`
- [x] **Update Dependencies for Shadcn-Svelte Ecosystem** `task_id: setup.dependencies_update`
- [x] **Update Vite Configuration** `task_id: setup.vite_config`

#### 1.2 Environment Setup

- [x] **Create Environment Files** `task_id: setup.environment_files`
  - There is currently a `.env.example` file in the root of the project, as well as a `.env` file in the root of the project. We will need to create a `.env.example` file in the `frontend` directory, and a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory with the SvelteKit-specific environment variables.
- [x] **Create Type-Safe Configuration** `task_id: setup.config_file`
  - This should be a proper SvelteKit configuration store, with the environment variables loaded from the `.env` file.

#### 1.3 API Integration Setup

- [x] **Create Server-Side API Client** `task_id: setup.server_api_client`
  - This should follow the SvelteKit and Superforms pattern of using `+page.server.ts` for server-side API calls to the backend API.
  - This should use fetch to make API calls to the backend API.
  - This should use Zod to validate the API responses.
  - **These should continue to be updated as we go through the migration, and should be used to update the stores.**
- [x] **Implement Idiomatic SvelteKit 5 Stores for Backend State** `task_id: setup.client_api_wrapper`
  - Replaced the generic client-side API wrapper with a set of Svelte 5 idiomatic stores (e.g., campaigns store) for managing backend state.
  - Stores are hydrated from SSR data and updated reactively after server actions.
  - This approach leverages SvelteKit's SSR, load functions, and actions for all data flow, ensuring type safety and idiomatic state management.
  - Example: `frontend/src/lib/stores/campaigns.ts` provides a reactive store for campaign data, hydrated from SSR and updated after actions.

  - Create documentation for when to use each testing approach
  - Add performance benchmarking between mock and real API test suites

#### 9.2 Testcontainers Architecture Details

**Python Test Orchestrator (`scripts/test-infrastructure.py`):**

```python
from testcontainers.postgres import PostgresContainer
from testcontainers.minio import MinioContainer
import json
import sys

def setup_test_infrastructure():
    """Start containers and return connection details for frontend tests."""
    with PostgresContainer("postgres:16") as postgres, \
         MinioContainer("minio/minio:latest") as minio:
        
        # Apply migrations and seed test data
        # ... (existing backend test setup logic)
        
        # Return connection details for frontend
        return {
            "postgres_url": postgres.get_connection_url(),
            "minio_endpoint": minio.get_config()["endpoint"],
            "minio_access_key": minio.get_config()["access_key"],
            "minio_secret_key": minio.get_config()["secret_key"],
        }

if __name__ == "__main__":
    config = setup_test_infrastructure()
    print(json.dumps(config))  # Frontend reads this
```

**Frontend Test Setup (`frontend/test-setup.js`):**

```javascript
import { execSync } from 'child_process';

export async function setupTestInfrastructure() {
  // Call Python script to start containers
  const configJson = execSync('python ../scripts/test-infrastructure.py', { 
    encoding: 'utf8' 
  });
  
  const config = JSON.parse(configJson);
  
  // Set environment variables for tests
  process.env.API_BASE_URL = `http://localhost:${config.backend_port}`;
  process.env.TEST_MODE = 'integration';
  
  return config;
}
```

**Updated Playwright Config:**

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import { setupTestInfrastructure } from './test-setup.js';

export default defineConfig({
  globalSetup: async () => {
    if (process.env.TEST_MODE === 'integration') {
      await setupTestInfrastructure();

## üìö Technical Implementation Details

### Stock Shadcn-Svelte Form Example

```svelte
<!-- frontend/src/routes/campaigns/new/+page.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
 import { superForm } from 'sveltekit-superforms';
 import { zodClient } from 'sveltekit-superforms/adapters';
 import { Field, Control, Label, FieldErrors } from 'formsnap';
 import { Button } from '$lib/components/ui/button';
 import { Input } from '$lib/components/ui/input';
 import { campaignSchema } from './schema';
 
 export let data;

 // Pure Superforms - no custom API integration
 const { form, errors, enhance, submitting } = superForm(data.form, {
  validators: zodClient(campaignSchema)
 });
</script>

<!-- Standard SvelteKit form - POSTs to same route -->
<form method="POST" use:enhance>
 <Field name="name" form={form}>
  <Control let:attrs>
   <Label>Campaign Name</Label>
   <Input {...attrs} bind:value={$form.name} />
  </Control>
  <FieldErrors />
 </Field>

 <Button type="submit" disabled={$submitting}>
  {$submitting ? 'Creating...' : 'Create Campaign'}
 </Button>
</form>
```

### Clean Server Action Pattern

```typescript
// frontend/src/routes/campaigns/new/+page.server.ts
import { superValidate } from 'sveltekit-superforms';
import { zod } from 'sveltekit-superforms/adapters';
import { fail, redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import { campaignSchema } from './schema';
import { serverApi, convertCampaignData } from '$lib/server/api';
import type { Actions, PageServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ cookies }) => {
 // Initialize form with Superforms
 const form = await superValidate(zod(campaignSchema));
 return { form };
};

export const actions: Actions = {
 default: async ({ request, cookies }) => {
  // Superforms handles validation
  const form = await superValidate(request, zod(campaignSchema));
  
  if (!form.valid) {
   return fail(400, { form });
  }
  
  try {
   // Convert Superforms data ‚Üí CipherSwarm API format
   const apiPayload = convertCampaignData(form.data);
   
   // Call backend API
   const campaign = await serverApi.post('/api/v1/web/campaigns/', apiPayload, {
    Cookie: cookies.get('sessionid') || ''
   });
   
   return redirect(303, `/campaigns/${campaign.id}`);
  } catch (error) {
   return fail(500, { form, message: 'Failed to create campaign' });
  }
 }
};
```

### Migration Verification Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check migration completion

## üéì Lessons Learned from Migration

### Critical Configuration Issues

#### 1. **Prerendering Conflicts**

**Problem:** Having `export const prerender = true;` in `+layout.ts` while disabling prerendering in `svelte.config.js` causes routing failures.

**Solution:** Ensure consistent prerendering configuration across all files:

```typescript
// frontend/src/routes/+layout.ts
export const prerender = false; // Must match svelte.config.js
```

**Lesson:** Always check layout files when experiencing routing issues in SSR apps.

#### 2. **Test Environment Detection**

**Problem:** SSR load functions require authentication, but Playwright tests run without session cookies, causing 401 errors.

**Solution:** Implement proper test environment detection with fallback mock data:

```typescript
// In +page.server.ts
export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ cookies }) => {
  // Detect test environment and provide mock data
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test' || process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_TEST || process.env.CI) {
    return { mockData };
  }
  
  // Normal SSR logic with authentication
  const sessionCookie = cookies.get('sessionid');
  if (!sessionCookie) {
    throw error(401, 'Authentication required');
  }
  // ... rest of load function
};
```

**Configuration:** Set environment variables in Playwright config:

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  webServer: {
    command: 'pnpm run build && pnpm run preview',
    port: 4173,
    env: {
      PLAYWRIGHT_TEST: 'true',
      NODE_ENV: 'test'
    }
  }
});
```

### Testing Strategy Lessons

#### 3. **Avoid Partial SSR Migration States**

**Problem:** Creating placeholder `+page.server.ts` files with mock data for routes that haven't been properly migrated creates more issues than it solves.

**Lesson:** Complete one route's SSR migration fully before moving to the next. Don't create partial SSR implementations just to make tests pass.

#### 4. **Test Command Strategy**

**Problem:** Running full `just ci-check` during development is slow and locks up shells.

**Best Practice:**

- Use specific test commands during development: `just frontend-check`, `just frontend-test-e2e`
- Only run `just ci-check` at the very end to verify everything works
- Use `pnpm exec playwright test --reporter=line --max-failures=1` for rapid iteration

#### 5. **SSR vs SPA Test Expectations**

**Problem:** Existing E2E tests expect SPA behavior (client-side API calls with `page.route()` mocking), but SSR makes server-side API calls that mocks don't intercept.

**Solution:** Update tests to match the new SSR architecture:

- Remove client-side API mocking for SSR routes
- Provide mock data through environment detection in SSR load functions
- Update test assertions to match actual rendered content

### Development Workflow Lessons

#### 6. **One Task at a Time**

**Lesson:** Focus on completing the current task fully before moving to the next. The dashboard SSR task was functionally complete, but partial migration attempts for other routes created unnecessary complexity.

#### 7. **Environment Variable Handling**

**Problem:** Environment variables behave differently in development vs. build vs. test environments.

**Best Practice:** Always test environment variable detection in the actual deployment environment (built + preview) that Playwright uses, not just development server.

#### 8. **Component Data Flow Changes**

**Major Change:** Converting from SPA to SSR fundamentally changes how components receive data:

- **Before:** Components use `onMount()` with axios calls
- **After:** Components receive data via `export let data: PageData` from SSR

**Lesson:** This is a breaking change that affects both component logic and test expectations.

### Technical Implementation Lessons

#### 9. **Mock Data Structure Consistency**

**Problem:** Test failures due to mismatched data structures between mock data and actual API responses.

**Best Practice:** Ensure mock data in SSR load functions exactly matches the structure expected by components, including enum values (e.g., 'active' vs 'running' for campaign states).

#### 10. **Error Handling in SSR**

**Lesson:** SSR load functions need robust error handling with graceful fallbacks, especially for test environments and development scenarios where the backend might not be available.

### Future Migration Guidelines

#### 11. **Migration Order Priority**

1. Complete foundation setup first (adapters, environment, API clients)
2. Migrate one route completely before starting the next
3. Update tests immediately after each route migration
4. Verify each migration with targeted test commands
5. Only run full CI check after completing a logical group of routes

#### 12. **Testing Environment Setup**

For future SSR routes, ensure:

- Environment variable detection works in all environments
- Mock data is available for test scenarios
- Authentication requirements are properly handled
- Test assertions match the new SSR data flow

#### 13. Dashboard implementation Technical Lessons

- **SSR Testing Pattern:** Use URL parameters for test scenarios instead of route mocking
- **Component State Migration:** All reactive state must use Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`)
- **HTML Validation:** SSR reveals HTML structure issues that client-side rendering might hide
- **Data Flow:** SSR requires careful consideration of server-to-client data transformation

**Benefits of This Task-Based Approach:**

1. **Clear Sequential Execution** - Each phase builds on the previous
2. **Granular Task IDs** - Easy to grep and find next unchecked task  
3. **Logical Grouping** - Related tasks are grouped together
4. **Verification Built-In** - Testing and verification throughout
5. **Minimal Custom Code** - Leverage Superforms' built-in SvelteKit features
6. **Easy Maintenance** - Stays close to Shadcn-Svelte documentation
7. **Progressive Enhancement** - Works without JavaScript by default
8. **Clean Separation** - Form logic vs. API conversion are separate concerns
9. **Type Safety** - End-to-end type safety with minimal complexity
