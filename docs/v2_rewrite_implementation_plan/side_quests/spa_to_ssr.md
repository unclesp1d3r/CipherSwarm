# üîÑ SPA to SSR Migration Plan - Task-Based Execution

## üìã Overview

This document outlines the complete migration plan for transitioning CipherSwarm from a static SvelteKit SPA served by FastAPI to a fully decoupled, dynamic SvelteKit application with SSR capabilities.

When in doubt about the implementation, refer to notes in the `docs/v2_rewrite_implementation_plan/notes` directory, as well as the `docs/development/user_journey_flowchart.mmd` file.

**Current State:**

- SvelteKit app using `adapter-static` with `fallback: 'index.html'`  
- FastAPI serves frontend via `StaticFiles` mount at root (`/`)
- Frontend makes API calls using relative paths (`/api/v1/web/*`)
- No SSR, broken deep linking, limited form handling

**Target State:**

- SvelteKit app using `adapter-node` with SSR
- Decoupled frontend server consuming FastAPI as an API service
- Proper environment-based API configuration
- Full SSR, working deep links, SvelteKit form actions with Shadcn-Svelte + Superforms

## üéØ Key Architectural Decision: "Stock Shadcn-Svelte" Approach

**Philosophy:** Leverage Superforms' built-in SvelteKit integration instead of custom API clients.

**Implementation Strategy:**

1. ‚úÖ **Forms use standard SvelteKit form actions** (POST to same route)
2. ‚úÖ **Superforms handles validation & progressive enhancement** (out-of-the-box)
3. ‚úÖ **Server-side conversion** of validated data to CipherSwarm API format
4. ‚úÖ **Components stay close to stock Shadcn-Svelte** patterns for maintainability

**Benefits:**

- Minimal custom code to maintain
- Maximum compatibility with Shadcn-Svelte ecosystem updates
- Progressive enhancement works automatically
- Clean separation between form concerns and API concerns

## üìù TASK EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup

#### 1.1 Update Dependencies and Configuration

- [x] **Update SvelteKit Adapter** `task_id: setup.adapter_update`
- [x] **Update Dependencies for Shadcn-Svelte Ecosystem** `task_id: setup.dependencies_update`
- [x] **Update Vite Configuration** `task_id: setup.vite_config`

#### 1.2 Environment Setup

- [x] **Create Environment Files** `task_id: setup.environment_files`
  - There is currently a `.env.example` file in the root of the project, as well as a `.env` file in the root of the project. We will need to create a `.env.example` file in the `frontend` directory, and a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory with the SvelteKit-specific environment variables.
- [x] **Create Type-Safe Configuration** `task_id: setup.config_file`
  - This should be a proper SvelteKit configuration store, with the environment variables loaded from the `.env` file.

#### 1.3 API Integration Setup

- [x] **Create Server-Side API Client** `task_id: setup.server_api_client`
  - This should follow the SvelteKit and Superforms pattern of using `+page.server.ts` for server-side API calls to the backend API.
  - This should use fetch to make API calls to the backend API.
  - This should use Zod to validate the API responses.
  - **These should continue to be updated as we go through the migration, and should be used to update the stores.**
- [x] **Implement Idiomatic SvelteKit 5 Stores for Backend State** `task_id: setup.client_api_wrapper`
  - Replaced the generic client-side API wrapper with a set of Svelte 5 idiomatic stores (e.g., campaigns store) for managing backend state.
  - Stores are hydrated from SSR data and updated reactively after server actions.
  - This approach leverages SvelteKit's SSR, load functions, and actions for all data flow, ensuring type safety and idiomatic state management.
  - Example: `frontend/src/lib/stores/campaigns.ts` provides a reactive store for campaign data, hydrated from SSR and updated after actions.

## üìö Technical Implementation Details

### Stock Shadcn-Svelte Form Example

```svelte
<!-- frontend/src/routes/campaigns/new/+page.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
 import { superForm } from 'sveltekit-superforms';
 import { zodClient } from 'sveltekit-superforms/adapters';
 import { Field, Control, Label, FieldErrors } from 'formsnap';
 import { Button } from '$lib/components/ui/button';
 import { Input } from '$lib/components/ui/input';
 import { campaignSchema } from './schema';
 
 export let data;

 // Pure Superforms - no custom API integration
 const { form, errors, enhance, submitting } = superForm(data.form, {
  validators: zodClient(campaignSchema)
 });
</script>

<!-- Standard SvelteKit form - POSTs to same route -->
<form method="POST" use:enhance>
 <Field name="name" form={form}>
  <Control let:attrs>
   <Label>Campaign Name</Label>
   <Input {...attrs} bind:value={$form.name} />
  </Control>
  <FieldErrors />
 </Field>

 <Button type="submit" disabled={$submitting}>
  {$submitting ? 'Creating...' : 'Create Campaign'}
 </Button>
</form>
```

### Clean Server Action Pattern

```typescript
// frontend/src/routes/campaigns/new/+page.server.ts
import { superValidate } from 'sveltekit-superforms';
import { zod } from 'sveltekit-superforms/adapters';
import { fail, redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import { campaignSchema } from './schema';
import { serverApi, convertCampaignData } from '$lib/server/api';
import type { Actions, PageServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ cookies }) => {
 // Initialize form with Superforms
 const form = await superValidate(zod(campaignSchema));
 return { form };
};

export const actions: Actions = {
 default: async ({ request, cookies }) => {
  // Superforms handles validation
  const form = await superValidate(request, zod(campaignSchema));
  
  if (!form.valid) {
   return fail(400, { form });
  }
  
  try {
   // Convert Superforms data ‚Üí CipherSwarm API format
   const apiPayload = convertCampaignData(form.data);
   
   // Call backend API
   const campaign = await serverApi.post('/api/v1/web/campaigns/', apiPayload, {
    Cookie: cookies.get('sessionid') || ''
   });
   
   return redirect(303, `/campaigns/${campaign.id}`);
  } catch (error) {
   return fail(500, { form, message: 'Failed to create campaign' });
  }
 }
};
```

### Migration Verification Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check migration completion

## üéì Lessons Learned from Migration

### üîß Configuration & Environment

#### **Prerendering Conflicts**

- **Issue:** `export const prerender = true;` in `+layout.ts` conflicts with `svelte.config.js` settings
- **Fix:** Ensure consistent prerendering config across all files
- **Rule:** Always check layout files when experiencing SSR routing issues

#### **Test Environment Detection**

- **Issue:** SSR load functions require auth, but Playwright tests lack session cookies
- **Fix:** Implement environment detection with fallback mock data

```typescript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test' || process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_TEST || process.env.CI) {
  return { mockData };
}
```

- **Config:** Set `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST: 'true'` in Playwright webServer env

#### **Environment Variable Handling**

- **Issue:** Environment variables behave differently across dev/build/test
- **Rule:** Always test env detection in actual deployment environment (built + preview)

---

### üß™ Testing Strategy

#### **Migration Approach**

- **Rule:** Complete one route's SSR migration fully before starting the next
- **Anti-pattern:** Don't create placeholder `+page.server.ts` files with mock data

#### **Test Command Strategy**

- **Development:** Use `just frontend-check`, `just frontend-test-e2e`
- **Final verification:** Only run `just ci-check` at the very end
- **Rapid iteration:** `pnpm exec playwright test --reporter=line --max-failures=1`

#### **SSR vs SPA Test Expectations**

- **Issue:** E2E tests expect SPA behavior, but SSR makes server-side API calls
- **Fix:** Remove client-side API mocking, provide mock data via environment detection
- **Rule:** Update test assertions to match actual rendered content

#### **Mock Data Consistency**

- **Issue:** Test failures from mismatched data structures
- **Rule:** Mock data must exactly match API response structure, including enum values

---

### üèóÔ∏è Development Workflow

#### **Task Focus**

- **Rule:** One task at a time - complete current task fully before moving to next
- **Anti-pattern:** Partial migration attempts create unnecessary complexity

#### **Component Data Flow Changes**

- **Before:** Components use `onMount()` with axios calls
- **After:** Components receive data via `export let data: PageData` from SSR
- **Impact:** Breaking change affecting both component logic and test expectations

#### **Error Handling in SSR**

- **Rule:** SSR load functions need robust error handling with graceful fallbacks
- **Critical:** Handle test environments and scenarios where backend unavailable

---

### üìã Migration Guidelines

#### **Migration Order Priority**

1. Complete foundation setup (adapters, environment, API clients)
2. Migrate one route completely before starting next
3. Update tests immediately after each route migration
4. Verify with targeted test commands
5. Run full CI check only after completing logical groups

#### **SSR Route Requirements**

- Environment variable detection works in all environments
- Mock data available for test scenarios
- Authentication requirements properly handled
- Test assertions match new SSR data flow

#### **SSR Implementation Patterns**

- **Testing:** Use URL parameters for test scenarios instead of route mocking
- **State:** All reactive state must use Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`)
- **Validation:** SSR reveals HTML structure issues that client-side rendering hides
- **Data Flow:** Careful consideration of server-to-client data transformation

### üé® Formsnap & Shadcn-Svelte Integration

#### **Proper Formsnap Pattern** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

- **Anti-pattern:** Don't abandon Formsnap for basic HTML when encountering issues
- **Correct pattern:** Always use proper Formsnap implementation

```svelte
<Field {form} name="fieldName">
  <Control>
    {#snippet children({ props })}
      <Label>Field Label</Label>
      <Input {...props} bind:value={$formData.fieldName} />
    {/snippet}
  </Control>
  <FieldErrors />
</Field>
```

- **Requirements:**
  - Use Svelte 5 snippet syntax: `{#snippet children({ props })}`
  - Destructure `props` from snippet parameter, not `attrs`
  - Import from `formsnap` directly: `import { Field, Control, Label, FieldErrors } from 'formsnap'`

#### **Component Import Patterns**

- **Correct:** Namespace imports for multi-component libraries

```typescript
import * as Accordion from '$lib/components/ui/accordion/index.js';
// Usage: Accordion.Root, Accordion.Item, etc.
```

- **Avoid:** Individual file imports that may not exist
- **Rule:** Check component's `index.ts` file for correct export structure

#### **FileDropZone Integration**

- **Requirements:** Specific prop types and callback signatures

```typescript
function handleFilesSelected(files: File[]) { /* ... */ }
function handleFileRejected({ reason, file }: { reason: string; file: File }) { /* ... */ }
```

- **Props:** Use `string` type for rejection reason, not `any`
- **Callbacks:** Must match exactly: `onUpload`, `onFileRejected`

#### **ESLint Compliance (Svelte 5)**

- **Critical rules:**
  - `svelte/require-each-key`: All `{#each}` blocks need unique keys
  - `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`: Replace `any` with proper types

```svelte
{#each items as item (item.id)}  <!-- ‚úÖ Correct -->
{#each items as item}            <!-- ‚ùå ESLint error -->
```

#### **Dependency Update Management**

- **Process:** Run `just frontend-check` immediately after Shadcn-Svelte updates
- **Rule:** Fix remaining issues systematically, don't assume all problems resolved
- **Benefit:** Updates can resolve complex TypeScript union type issues

#### **Complex Form Migration Strategy**

1. **Preserve Functionality First:** Ensure all features work in new SSR route
2. **Implement Proper Patterns:** Use correct Formsnap/Superforms from start
3. **Incremental Validation:** Fix linting issues immediately
4. **Test Early and Often:** Run targeted tests during development

- **Anti-pattern:** Don't create "working but incorrect" implementations

#### **Documentation as Source of Truth** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

- **Rule:** When Formsnap integration fails, refer to official Shadcn-Svelte docs
- **Key insight:** Documentation shows `{#snippet children({ props })}` for a reason
- **Verification:** Properly implemented Formsnap form serves as template for future forms

**Benefits of This Task-Based Approach:**

1. **Clear Sequential Execution** - Each phase builds on the previous
2. **Granular Task IDs** - Easy to grep and find next unchecked task  
3. **Logical Grouping** - Related tasks are grouped together
4. **Verification Built-In** - Testing and verification throughout
5. **Minimal Custom Code** - Leverage Superforms' built-in SvelteKit features
6. **Easy Maintenance** - Stays close to Shadcn-Svelte documentation
7. **Progressive Enhancement** - Works without JavaScript by default
8. **Clean Separation** - Form logic vs. API conversion are separate concerns
9. **Type Safety** - End-to-end type safety with minimal complexity
