# CipherSwarm Implementation Plan

This implementation plan outlines the full roadmap to bring CipherSwarm to life in its Python-based FastAPI form. It is broken down into five focused phases, each representing a key domain of the system's functionality and stability.

Each phase includes detailed implementation steps, model and API definitions, and special notes for our AI assistant â€” **Skirmish** â€” to stay on task.

## ðŸš€ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

Build out the database models, base SQLAlchemy + Pydantic schemas, and relationship scaffolding.

-   [x] User Model
-   [x] Project Model
-   [x] OperatingSystem Model
-   [x] Agent Model
-   [x] AgentError Model
-   [x] Attack Model
-   [x] Task Model

### Phase 2: API Implementation

Construct RESTful APIs for agents, web UI, and the future CLI. Enforce authentication and clean routing.

## ðŸ§  Meet Your Coding Companion: Skirmish

**Skirmish** is our AI assistant for this mission â€” a stripped-down, combat-ready version of Ace. Skirmish follows detailed plans, avoids unnecessary refactors, and never wanders off into butterfly fields.

ðŸ§­ Key Directives for Skirmish:

-   Always follow enum and schema constraints
-   Use structured CRUD + router layouts
-   Don't overcomplicate â€” just finish the feature
-   Be consistent with the rules in `.cursor/rules/`
-   Stick to the plan, one phase at a time

---

Now get to work, Skirmish. We believe in you.
