## 🪪 Introduction & Scope

### Project Overview

- **Project Description and Purpose**  
  CipherSwarm is a distributed password cracking management system designed for efficiency, scalability, and airgapped networks. It coordinates multiple hashcat instances across different machines to efficiently crack password hashes using various attack strategies, with a modern web interface and robust API.

- **Project Goals and Objectives**  
  • Enable distributed hashcat cracking across multiple machines with centralized coordination
  • Provide modern, user-friendly web interface for campaign and attack management
  • Support offline-first operations in airgapped environments
  • Maintain compatibility with existing agent infrastructure while modernizing the platform
  • Deliver comprehensive monitoring and real-time progress tracking
  • Support role-based access control and multi-project environments

- **Target Audience and Stakeholders**  
  • **Red Team Operators**: Primary users conducting password audits and penetration testing
  • **Blue Team Analysts**: Security professionals analyzing password complexity and patterns
  • **Infrastructure Administrators**: IT personnel managing and maintaining the distributed cracking infrastructure
  • **Project Managers**: Oversight personnel tracking progress and resource utilization

- **Project Boundaries and Limitations**  
  • Only supports hashcat as the cracking engine (no John the Ripper or other tools)
  • Designed for trusted LAN environments, not Internet-facing deployments
  • Requires high-speed, reliable network connections between agents
  • Not intended for anonymous or untrusted client connections

### Scope Definition

- **In-scope Features and Functionality**
  • Complete rewrite from Ruby on Rails to FastAPI + SvelteKit architecture
  • Agent API with full v1 contract compatibility for seamless migration
  • Modern Web UI with real-time updates and comprehensive campaign management
  • Three-tier testing architecture with Docker-based E2E testing
  • Resource management with MinIO object storage integration
  • Hash type detection and automated wordlist generation
  • Campaign templates with import/export capabilities
  • Role-based access control with project-level isolation

- **Out-of-scope Items**
  • Support for cracking tools other than hashcat
  • Internet-facing or cloud-based deployments
  • Advanced machine learning or AI-based attack strategies
  • Integration with external identity providers (beyond basic auth)

- **Success Criteria and Acceptance Criteria**
  • All existing v1 agents can connect and operate without modification
  • Web UI provides feature parity with existing Rails application
  • System can handle distributed workloads across 10+ agents simultaneously
  • E2E tests provide comprehensive coverage of all user workflows
  • Performance meets or exceeds existing Ruby on Rails implementation

- **Timeline and Milestones**
  • **Phase 1**: Core Infrastructure ✅ **COMPLETED**
  • **Phase 2**: API Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED** (2/3 parts)
  • **Phase 3**: Web UI Development ✅ **COMPLETED**
  • **Phase 4**: Containerization and Deployment
  • **Phase 5**: Task Distribution System
  • **Phase 6**: Monitoring, Testing and Documentation

### Context and Background

- **Business Context and Justification**
  Legacy Ruby on Rails system requires modernization for maintainability, performance, and feature development. The v2 rewrite addresses technical debt while maintaining operational continuity.

- **Previous Work and Dependencies**
  • Existing v1 API contract that must be maintained for agent compatibility
  • Established user workflows and UI patterns that need preservation
  • Current production deployments that require seamless migration path

- **Assumptions and Constraints**
  • All client machines are trustworthy and under direct user control
  • Users belong to the same organization or project team
  • High-speed LAN connectivity between all system components
  • PostgreSQL and MinIO infrastructure available for deployment

- **Risk Assessment Overview**
  • **Technical Risk**: Complexity of maintaining v1 API compatibility during rewrite
  • **Operational Risk**: Potential disruption during migration from Rails to FastAPI
  • **Performance Risk**: Ensuring new architecture matches or exceeds current performance
  • **User Risk**: Learning curve for new UI patterns and workflows

- **F009**: Agent monitoring with hardware configuration and performance tracking
- **F010**: Distributed task scheduling with automatic load balancing

### User Stories and Use Cases

1. **Campaign Lifecycle Management**: Red team operator creates a campaign, configures multiple attack strategies, launches distributed cracking across available agents, monitors progress in real-time, and exports results for reporting.

2. **Agent Fleet Management**: Infrastructure administrator registers new cracking agents, configures hardware settings, monitors performance and health status, and manages device assignments for optimal utilization.

3. **Resource Library Operations**: Security analyst uploads custom wordlists and rule files, organizes resources by project, shares resources across teams, and maintains version control through templates.
