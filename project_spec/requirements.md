## ü™™ Introduction & Scope

### Project Overview

- **Project Description and Purpose**  
  CipherSwarm is a distributed password cracking management system designed for efficiency, scalability, and airgapped networks. It coordinates multiple hashcat instances across different machines to efficiently crack password hashes using various attack strategies, with a modern web interface and robust API.

- **Project Goals and Objectives**  
  ‚Ä¢ Enable distributed hashcat cracking across multiple machines with centralized coordination
  ‚Ä¢ Provide modern, user-friendly web interface for campaign and attack management
  ‚Ä¢ Support offline-first operations in airgapped environments
  ‚Ä¢ Maintain compatibility with existing agent infrastructure while modernizing the platform
  ‚Ä¢ Deliver comprehensive monitoring and real-time progress tracking
  ‚Ä¢ Support role-based access control and multi-project environments

- **Target Audience and Stakeholders**  
  ‚Ä¢ **Red Team Operators**: Primary users conducting password audits and penetration testing
  ‚Ä¢ **Blue Team Analysts**: Security professionals analyzing password complexity and patterns
  ‚Ä¢ **Infrastructure Administrators**: IT personnel managing and maintaining the distributed cracking infrastructure
  ‚Ä¢ **Project Managers**: Oversight personnel tracking progress and resource utilization

- **Project Boundaries and Limitations**  
  ‚Ä¢ Only supports hashcat as the cracking engine (no John the Ripper or other tools)
  ‚Ä¢ Designed for trusted LAN environments, not Internet-facing deployments
  ‚Ä¢ Requires high-speed, reliable network connections between agents
  ‚Ä¢ Not intended for anonymous or untrusted client connections

### Scope Definition

- **In-scope Features and Functionality**
  ‚Ä¢ Complete rewrite from Ruby on Rails to FastAPI + SvelteKit architecture
  ‚Ä¢ Agent API with full v1 contract compatibility for seamless migration
  ‚Ä¢ Modern Web UI with real-time updates and comprehensive campaign management
  ‚Ä¢ Three-tier testing architecture with Docker-based E2E testing
  ‚Ä¢ Resource management with MinIO object storage integration
  ‚Ä¢ Hash type detection and automated wordlist generation
  ‚Ä¢ Campaign templates with import/export capabilities
  ‚Ä¢ Role-based access control with project-level isolation

- **Out-of-scope Items**
  ‚Ä¢ Support for cracking tools other than hashcat
  ‚Ä¢ Internet-facing or cloud-based deployments
  ‚Ä¢ Advanced machine learning or AI-based attack strategies
  ‚Ä¢ Integration with external identity providers (beyond basic auth)

- **Success Criteria and Acceptance Criteria**
  ‚Ä¢ All existing v1 agents can connect and operate without modification
  ‚Ä¢ Web UI provides feature parity with existing Rails application
  ‚Ä¢ System can handle distributed workloads across 10+ agents simultaneously
  ‚Ä¢ E2E tests provide comprehensive coverage of all user workflows
  ‚Ä¢ Performance meets or exceeds existing Ruby on Rails implementation

- **Timeline and Milestones**
  ‚Ä¢ **Phase 1**: Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  ‚Ä¢ **Phase 2**: API Implementation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (2/3 parts)
  ‚Ä¢ **Phase 3**: Web UI Development ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  ‚Ä¢ **Phase 4**: Containerization and Deployment
  ‚Ä¢ **Phase 5**: Task Distribution System
  ‚Ä¢ **Phase 6**: Monitoring, Testing and Documentation

### Context and Background

- **Business Context and Justification**
  Legacy Ruby on Rails system requires modernization for maintainability, performance, and feature development. The v2 rewrite addresses technical debt while maintaining operational continuity.

- **Previous Work and Dependencies**
  ‚Ä¢ Existing v1 API contract that must be maintained for agent compatibility
  ‚Ä¢ Established user workflows and UI patterns that need preservation
  ‚Ä¢ Current production deployments that require seamless migration path

- **Assumptions and Constraints**
  ‚Ä¢ All client machines are trustworthy and under direct user control
  ‚Ä¢ Users belong to the same organization or project team
  ‚Ä¢ High-speed LAN connectivity between all system components
  ‚Ä¢ PostgreSQL and MinIO infrastructure available for deployment

- **Risk Assessment Overview**
  ‚Ä¢ **Technical Risk**: Complexity of maintaining v1 API compatibility during rewrite
  ‚Ä¢ **Operational Risk**: Potential disruption during migration from Rails to FastAPI
  ‚Ä¢ **Performance Risk**: Ensuring new architecture matches or exceeds current performance
  ‚Ä¢ **User Risk**: Learning curve for new UI patterns and workflows
